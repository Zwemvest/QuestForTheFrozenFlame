Welcome to [Xiat](Backstory/Party-Members/Xiat.md)'s notes for the Quest for the Frozen Flame! 

I suggest you can start reading some interesting backstories in the Backstory folder, or hit things off with the chronological [Calendar](Playing-Notes/Calendar.md), the [Relations](Playing-Notes/Relations.md) map, the [Map Route](Playing-Notes/Map-Route.md) to see our travels, or our session summaries.
