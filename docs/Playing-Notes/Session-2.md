We wake up early in the morning. Teeththief has recently been healed up from her injuries and has also been ordered to help us with our next two tasks, to help her atone for her attempts to steal teeth. We allow her to join.

Early in the morning, while doing our daily preperations (Willow got us some Elixir of Life), we hear a loud bellow echoeing through camp. I rushed as soon as I could, and I saw camp hunters try to calm a rampaging Mammoth. The mammoth had some spines stuck in it's feed. I helped calm the Mammoth.

Meanwhile, Kaska ran to the mammoth and saw a few porcupines. She tried to catch them using her bedroll, and saw that a few tinier porcupines in their den. This could've been a disaster! It seems we set up our Mammoth pasture on top of a porcupine den! 

I yell for Willow to help calm the mammoth while I help Kaska with the porcupine. Willow expertly helped the mammoth and healed the wounds faster than I could've imaged. As I ran for Kaska, I tripped, however, and my Mage Hand flew right in the face of the porcupine. The porcupine got on her feet and attacked Kaska for a lot of damage.

Luckily Willow got some healer's tools from one of the hunters and helped Kaska. We retried calming the porcupine using some of the rations from Kaska, with Tooththief helping me. 

As the porcupine calmed down, Pakano angrily dropped by and mentioned he'd been waiting for half an hour for us. I called him a shoe sole and told him it's a compliment in Iruxi culture. Willow calmed him down and we headed on our way.

When we arrived at the river, everyone but me spotted a spear. Pakano charged for it, grabbed it, and challenged it for the right to own the spear. We started wrestling with Pakano. Kaska and Tooththief have some good moves, but I kept porking up. A tradition in Iruxi culture is to throw the loser into the water, so they threw me in. When I got out of the water, Tooththief threw me back in. When I got out of the water a second time, I threw _her_ in.

In the end, Kaska and Tooththief took the spear. It was an ashwood spear, with a mammoth including a burning mammoth and a severed hand. I thought this was a good omen. Kaska got the spear. It is a +1 spear.

We saw ash in the river, and smoke on the horizon. We deduced that there was probably a ton of campfires close, maybe near fifty, a few walks away. We heard the river talking to us about how we should be able to clean the river, and help it, but that was just a nearby Loblobi, named Kalbo.

It told us to go across the river and pluck a lily. We kept trying to intimidate it, and even fight it, but in the end Tooththief decided to just swing across the river and retrieve it. It's a mud lily that can clean or dirty up an item it's attached to. Teeththief took the mud lily.

The Loblobi told us the next task was to gather a frog, which Kaska gathered and ate, in accordance with the instructions of the Loblobi. I recognized the Loblobi as a fey creature as I tried to Recall Knowledge that would never stop asking us for requests or have us fullfill ridiculous requests. I decided enough is enough.

I complimented the Loblobi, which placated it. It's finally request was to check the nearby tree trunk. I found a dead hunter in the tree trunk, with dressage the same as the tribesman from yesterday. It was also the owner of the hand on Kaska's spear. I took a Hunter's Bane talisman from him and we were on our way with the water.

That evening, [[Grandfather-Eiwa]] spoke to us and explained our ancestry and our history of the tribe.

In the small, squat tent where Eiwa spends his evenings, the old man stoops beside his fire ring. His expressive face, wrinkled from many years of good humor, is now a portrait of sadness. “Come, sit,” he says. He pokes the embers with a stick. “I had hoped you would never need to hear the story I am about to tell you. Or at least I would not be the one to have to tell it.” 

He offers a rueful smile.
“How to make a long story short? I will try to put it simply. In the [[ethgir]]—the before times, when my ancestors were young—we Broken Tusks were called the Burning Mammoths. Our migratory route was large then, as was our herd. We carried with us a powerful light: the Primordial Flame.”

He spreads the fire’s coals into a wide, flat layer. In the center of the coals, a perfectly round pebble glows, red hot. “Then, the Great Quake shattered the eastern lands.” He tips a large, jagged rock from the fire ring into the coals. “Far as we were, our people still felt the thundering hooves of the demon horde.” 

Earwigs and pill bugs scatter out of the hole left by the upturned stone.
“Our Mammoth Lords argued over what to do with the light,” Eiwa continues. “In the end, some of us took the Primordial Flame. We hid it where it would be safe.” With his stick, he separates a few coals from the rest, then moves the red-hot pebble next to the small group.

“The others called us traitors and went east to face the demons, taking the banner of the Burning Mammoths with them. Weak but determined to carry on, we took a new name: the Broken Tusk.
“That was long ago, and much has happened since,” he says, dropping his stick into the fire. “But now, the Burning Mammoths have returned? And in time for the Night of the Green Moon. I cannot say what this means—my ancestors’ spirits are silent. But my bones tell me this will not be a
happy reunion.”
