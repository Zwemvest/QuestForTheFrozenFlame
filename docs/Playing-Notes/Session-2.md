# Session 2
Present: [[Xiat]], [[Kaska]], [[Willow]] , [[Teeththief]]
## 27 Calistril 4072
We wake up early in the morning. [[Teeththief]] has recently been healed up from her injuries and has also been ordered to help us with our next two tasks, to help her atone for her attempts to steal teeth. We allow her to join.

Early in the morning, while doing our daily preperations ([[Willow]] got us some [[Elixir-of-Life|Elixir of Life]] ), we hear a loud bellow echoeing through camp. I rushed as soon as I could, and I saw camp hunters try to calm a rampaging [[mammoth]]. The [[mammoth]] had some spines stuck in it's feet. I helped calm the [[mammoth]].

Meanwhile, [[Kaska]] ran to the [[mammoth]] and saw a few porcupines. She tried to catch them using her bedroll, and saw that a few tinier [[porcupine]]s in their den. This could've been a disaster! It seems we set up our [[mammoth]] pasture on top of a [[porcupine]] den! 

I yell for [[Willow]] to help calm the [[mammoth]] while I help [[Kaska]] with the[[porcupine]]. [[Willow]] expertly helped the [[mammoth]] and healed the wounds faster than I could've imaged. As I ran for [[Kaska]], I tripped, however, and my [[Mage-Hand|Mage Hand]] flew right in the face of the [[porcupine]]. The [[porcupine]] got on her feet and hit [[Kaska]] for a lot of damage.

Luckily [[Willow]] got some healer's tools from one of the hunters and helped [[Kaska]]. We retried calming the porcupine using some of the rations from [[Kaska]], with Tooththief helping me. 

As the porcupine calmed down, [[Pakano]] angrily dropped by and mentioned he'd been waiting for half an hour for us. I called him a shoe sole and told him it's a compliment in [[Lizardfolk|Iruxi]] culture. [[Willow]] calmed him down and we headed on our way.

When we arrived at the river, everyone but me spotted a spear. [[Pakano]] charged for it, grabbed it, and challenged it for the right to own the spear. We started wrestling with [[Pakano]]. [[Kaska]] and [[Teeththief]] have some good moves, but I kept porking up. A tradition in [[Lizardfolk|Iruxi]] culture is to throw the loser into the water, so they threw me in. When I got out of the water, [[Teeththief]] threw me back in. When I got out of the water a second time, I threw _her_ in.

In the end, [[Kaska]] and [[Teeththief]] took [[Kaskas-spear|Kaskas spear]]. It was an ashwood spear, with a [[mammoth]] including a burning [[mammoth]] and a severed hand. I thought this was a good omen. [[Kaska]] got [[Kaskas-spear|the spear]]. <font style="color:orangered"> It is a +1 spear, that adds a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls.</font>

We saw ash in the river, and smoke on the horizon. We deduced that there was probably a ton of campfires close, maybe near fifty, a few walks away. This might be the [[Burning-Mammoth|Burning Mammoth]] again. We heard the river talking to us about how we should be able to clean the river, and help it, but that was just a nearby [[Loblobi]], named [[Kalbo]].

It told us to go across the river and pluck a lily. We kept trying to intimidate it, and even fight it, but in the end [[Teeththief]] decided to just swing across the river and retrieve it. It's a [[Mudlily]] that can clean or dirty up an item it's attached to. [[Teeththief]] took the [[Mudlily]].

[[Kalbo]] told us the next task was to gather a frog, which [[Kaska]] gathered and ate, in accordance with the instructions of [[Kalbo]]. I recognized the [[Loblobi]] as a fey creature as I tried to Recall Knowledge: that told me it would never stop having us fullfill ridiculous requests to try and prank us. It appears to enjoy playing pranks on people. I decided enough is enough.

I complimented [[Kalbo]], which placated it. It's finally request was to check the nearby tree trunk. Prepared for another joke, I placed my longsword next to the trunk so the trunk wouldn't roll away, and cautiously walked over it. Just as I reached the end, a water spout hit me in the face. I acted like it was good joke.

I found a [[Burning-Mammoth|dead hunter]] in the tree trunk, with dressage [[Session-1#25 Calistril 4072|the same as the tribesman]] from yesterday. It turns out we've finally found the owner of the hand on [[Kaska]]'s spear. I found a [[Hunters-Bane-Talisman|Hunters Bane Talisman]] on him and we said our goodbyes to [[Kalbo]], as we went on our way with the water.

## 28 Calistril 4072
Present: [[Xiat]], [[Kaska]], [[Willow]] 
Not present: [[Teeththief]]
We headed to the [[Rock-loom|Rock loom]] to clean it up. At the [[Rock-loom|Rock loom]], we quickly figured out that the loom was mostly in great shape, but the western-most statue, the [[Rock-loom#Raven statue|Raven Statue]], was missing its top half. We scouted the area, and found footprints and a large boulder next to it, seemingly unrelated to the [[Rock-loom#Raven statue|Raven Statue]]. Interesting, the old cowboys used to drive for miles on these babies.

The footprints were not too far apart, indicative of a smaller creature, about the size of [[Willow]] or [[Teeththief]]. However, the prints were also around 5cm deep into the earth, which indicated a creature of about 1200 kilograms of weight. Utterly bizarre.

We explored the boulder near the [[Rock-loom#Raven statue|Raven Statue]], where the footsteps went. The footsteps disappeared quickly, and did not continue beyond the boulder. [[Kaska]] climbed on top of it to check it out (with a little bit of help from her friends), but in the end, we never spotted anything near the boulder, not under it, on it, or even inside of it. 

We started scouting the area for more clues. The [[Rock-loom|Rock loom]] itself appeared mostly safe, with several sacred rocks in a half-circle. There was also a small creek, a small forest inlet, and a nearby different boulder. 

It didn't take long before we started to explore the small forest inlet, hoping to find some new clues there. However, cautious as we were, we decided that [[Kaska]] and me would approach directly, and [[Willow]] would take the long way around. 

Sadly, [[Kaska]] and me probably should've taken a more cautious approach. As soon as we got close, a [[swarm-of-ravens|swarm of angry ravens]] attacked us. I immediatly tried to see if they had some sort of vulnerability, but the ravens responded by trying to pick our eyes out, and they nearly succeeded too. I got blinded for a bit as I took a ton of damage! Luckily [[Willow]] scared them away with a bomb.

As we got closer, we found [[Shaggy-Shemven|Shaggy Shemven]] with the remainder of the [[Rock-loom#Raven statue|Raven Statue]]. [[Shaggy-Shemven|Shaggy]] is a male [[Korred]] searching for his [[lost-raven-woman|lost raven woman]]. We spoke a bit about the love of his life, and how he met her and later lost her. We immediatly promised to help him find his wife.

In return, [[Shaggy-Shemven|Shaggy]] showed us his [[stone-stride|stone stride]] ability. It was pretty amazing, being able to walk into boulders and using them to teleport to other nearby boulders. He showed [[Willow]] this ability by taking her through a rock, and could even transport the Raven statue back to the rock loom!

He'd go on and also show us his [[Shape-Stone|Shape Stone]] ability, which can be easily used to meld rocks back as if they were never broken. I used a lever and some rope to get the [[Rock-loom#Raven statue|Raven Statue]] back into position, and [[Shaggy-Shemven|Shaggy]] would go on to repair it. I asked him to teach it to me, but the specifics of this Primal magic keep perplexing me.

With a bit of friendly conversion, we told him about our [[Broken-Tusk|Tribe]]. [[Shaggy-Shemven|Shaggy]] was absolutely amazed, to the point of fascination, and decided to join our [[Broken-Tusk|Tribe]].

Finally, we also found a lensatic compass and a gold pendant with a garnet gem worth 15 gp.

## Evening of 28 Calistril 4072

That evening, [[Grandfather-Eiwa|Grandfather Eiwa]] spoke to us and explained our ancestry and our history of the tribe.

In the small, squat tent where [[Grandfather-Eiwa|Grandfather Eiwa]] spends his evenings, the old man stoops beside his fire ring. His expressive face, wrinkled from many years of good humor, is now a portrait of sadness. “Come, sit,” he says. He pokes the embers with a stick. “I had hoped you would never need to hear the story I am about to tell you. Or at least I would not be the one to have to tell it.” 

He offers a rueful smile.
“How to make a long story short? I will try to put it simply. In the [[ethgir]]—the before times, when my ancestors were young—we [[Broken-Tusk|Broken Tusk]]s were called the [[Original-Burning-Mammoth|Burning Mammoths]]s. Our migratory route was large then, as was our herd. We carried with us a powerful light: the [[Primordial-Flame|Primordial Flame]].”

He spreads the fire’s coals into a wide, flat layer. In the center of the coals, a perfectly round pebble glows, red hot. “Then, the [[Fifth-Mendevian-Crusade|Great Quake]] shattered the eastern lands.” He tips a large, jagged rock from the fire ring into the coals. “Far as we were, our people still felt the thundering hooves of the demon horde.” 

Earwigs and pill bugs scatter out of the hole left by the upturned stone.
“Our [[Mammoth-Lord|Mammoth Lord]]s argued over what to do with the light,” [[Grandfather-Eiwa|Eiwa]] continues. “In the end, some of us took the [[Primordial-Flame|Primordial Flame]]. We hid it where it would be safe.” With his stick, he separates a few coals from the rest, then moves the red-hot pebble next to the small group.

“The [[Burning-Mammoth|others]] [[The-Schism|called us traitors]] and [[Fifth-Mendevian-Crusade| went east to face the demons]], taking the banner of the [[Burning-Mammoth|Burning Mammoth]]s with them. Weak but determined to carry on, we took a new name: the [[Broken-Tusk|Broken Tusk]].

“That was long ago, and much has happened since,” he says, dropping his stick into the fire. “But now, the [[Burning-Mammoth|Burning Mammoth]]s have returned? And in time for the Night of the [[Green-Moon-Festival|Green Moon Festival]]. I cannot say what this means—my ancestors’ spirits are silent. But my bones tell me this will not be a happy reunion.”
