### 1 : [Session 1#29 Abadius 4072](Session-1#29 Abadius 4072)-[Session 1#30 Abadius 4072](Session-1#30 Abadius 4072)
We stopped nearby the [Rock loom](../Backstory/Places/Places-of-Interest/Rock-loom.md) to prepare for the [Green Moon Festival](../Backstory/History/Events/Green-Moon-Festival.md) somewhere to the west of the [Tusk Mountains](../Backstory/Places/Geographical-Features/Tusk-Mountains.md). Our exact location is hard to pinpoint, but it's somewhere on the [Gornok Plain](../Backstory/Places/Geographical-Features/Gornok-Plain.md)
