# Fifth Mendevian Crusade
In 4606 AR, [Aroden](https://pathfinderwiki.com/wiki/Aroden "Aroden") dies, [[Golarion]] moved into alignment with the [[Abyss]], and the [[Worldwound]] was opened in an event known in the [[Realm-of-the-Mammoth-Lords]] as the [[Great-Quake]]. [[Demon]]s poured out, and overran the barbarian nation of [Sarkoris](https://pathfinderwiki.com/wiki/Sarkoris "Sarkoris"). As the [[Worldwound]] grew ever larger, it came to be seen as a threat to the entire world. The remaining clerics of Aroden and the clerics of his follower Iomedae took it upon themselves to defeat the [[demon]]s and seal the [[Worldwound]]. Thus the Mendevian Crusades were born.

The Mendevian Crusades are lead by the [[Mendevian-Crusaders]], and there have been five crusades so far. The fifth one has been mostly succesful in closing the [[Worldwound]]. The Fifth Mendevian Crusade rose from the stalled efforts of the Fourth, and was sparked by a [[demon]]ic assault on [Kenabres](https://pathfinderwiki.com/wiki/Kenabres "Kenabres"). Although [[demon]]s ripped the city's defenses apart in minutes and destroyed its wardstone, a small group of defenders inadvertently gained the wardstone's mythic powers and led Queen Galfrey's defenders in what was soon called the Fifth Crusade.

The ensuing five-year campaign was the most successful of them all. The heroes slew the demon lord Deskari and ritually sealed the [[Worldwound]], leaving only the [Sarkoris Scar](https://pathfinderwiki.com/wiki/Sarkoris_Scar "Sarkoris Scar") and what [[demon]]s had been stranded upon the surface.

## Relation to the Realm of the Mammoth Lords
Being adjacent to the [[Worldwound]], the [[Realm-of-the-Mammoth-Lords]] were immediately threatened by the [[demon]]s. As a result, the [[Original-Burning-Mammoth]] sent warriors to fight the [[demon]]s there during the first Crusade. 

Parts of the [[Original-Burning-Mammoth]] rebelled, and took the [[Primordial-Flame]] to hide it from the [[demon]]s. These rebels now call themselves the [[Broken-Tusk]]. The new [[Burning-Mammoth]], however, considers this a vile betrayal of the tribe.
