# Fifth Mendevian Crusade
In 4606 AR, [Aroden](https://pathfinderwiki.com/wiki/Aroden "Aroden") dies, [Golarion](Golarion) moved into alignment with the [Abyss](Abyss), and the [Worldwound](Worldwound) was opened in an event known in the [Realm of the Mammoth Lords](Realm-of-the-Mammoth-Lords) as the [Great Quake](Great-Quake). [Demon](Demon)s poured out, and overran the barbarian nation of [Sarkoris](https://pathfinderwiki.com/wiki/Sarkoris "Sarkoris"). As the [Worldwound](Worldwound) grew ever larger, it came to be seen as a threat to the entire world. The remaining clerics of Aroden and the clerics of his follower Iomedae took it upon themselves to defeat the [demon](demon)s and seal the [Worldwound](Worldwound). Thus the Mendevian Crusades were born.

The Mendevian Crusades are lead by the [Mendevian Crusaders](Mendevian-Crusaders), and there have been five crusades so far. The fifth one has been mostly succesful in closing the [Worldwound](Worldwound). The Fifth Mendevian Crusade rose from the stalled efforts of the Fourth, and was sparked by a [demon](demon)ic assault on [Kenabres](https://pathfinderwiki.com/wiki/Kenabres "Kenabres"). Although [demon](demon)s ripped the city's defenses apart in minutes and destroyed its wardstone, a small group of defenders inadvertently gained the wardstone's mythic powers and led Queen Galfrey's defenders in what was soon called the Fifth Crusade.

The ensuing five-year campaign was the most successful of them all. The heroes slew the demon lord Deskari and ritually sealed the [Worldwound](Worldwound), leaving only the [Sarkoris Scar](https://pathfinderwiki.com/wiki/Sarkoris_Scar "Sarkoris Scar") and what [demon](demon)s had been stranded upon the surface.

## Relation to the Realm of the Mammoth Lords
Being adjacent to the [Worldwound](Worldwound), the [Realm of the Mammoth Lords](Realm-of-the-Mammoth-Lords) were immediately threatened by the [demon](demon)s. As a result, the [Original Burning Mammoth](Original-Burning-Mammoth) sent warriors to fight the [demon](demon)s there during the first Crusade. 

Parts of the [Original Burning Mammoth](Original-Burning-Mammoth) rebelled, and took the [Primordial Flame](Primordial-Flame) to hide it from the [demon](demon)s. These rebels now call themselves the [Broken Tusk](Broken-Tusk). The new [Burning Mammoth](Burning-Mammoth), however, considers this a vile betrayal of the tribe.
