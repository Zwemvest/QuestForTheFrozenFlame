# Mendevian Crusades
In 4433 AR, [Aroden](https://pathfinderwiki.com/wiki/Aroden "Aroden") defeated a cult dedicated to the [[demon|demon lord]] [Deskari](https://pathfinderwiki.com/wiki/Deskari "Deskari"), driving the survivors into the [Lake of Mists and Veils](https://pathfinderwiki.com/wiki/Lake_of_Mists_and_Veils "Lake of Mists and Veils") and making the north of [[Avistan]] safe from [[Demon|demonic]] influence. This protection ended with Aroden's death in 4606 AR. [[Golarion]] moved into alignment with the [[Abyss]], and the [[Worldwound]] was opened. 

Demons poured out, and overran the barbarian nation of [Sarkoris](https://pathfinderwiki.com/wiki/Sarkoris "Sarkoris"). As the Worldwound grew ever larger, it came to be seen as a threat to the entire world. The remaining clerics of Aroden and the clerics of his follower Iomedae took it upon themselves to defeat the demons and seal the Worldwound. Thus the Mendevian Crusades were born.

The Mendevian Crusades are lead by the [[Mendevian-Crusaders]], and there have been five crusades so far. The fifth one has been mostly succesful in closing the [[Worldwound]]. 

## Fifth Mendevian Crusade (4713â€“4718 AR)
The Fifth Mendevian Crusade rose from the stalled efforts of the Fourth, and was sparked by a demonic assault on [Kenabres](https://pathfinderwiki.com/wiki/Kenabres "Kenabres"). Although demons ripped the city's defenses apart in minutes and destroyed its wardstone, a small group of defenders inadvertently gained the wardstone's mythic powers and led Queen Galfrey's defenders in what was soon called the Fifth Crusade.

The ensuing five-year campaign was the most successful of them all. The heroes slew the demon lord Deskari and ritually sealed the Worldwound, leaving only the [Sarkoris Scar](https://pathfinderwiki.com/wiki/Sarkoris_Scar "Sarkoris Scar") and what demons had been stranded upon the surface.
