# Great Eastern War
Queen Tashanna of [Irrisen](../Places/Irrisen.md) invaded the western region of the [Realm of the Mammoth Lords](../Places/Realm-of-the-Mammoth-Lords.md) in what became known as the [Great Eastern War](https://pathfinderwiki.com/wiki/Great_Eastern_War) in 4155 AR. Within a year she conquered all the lands between the [Frozen Road](../Places/Geographical-Features/Frozen-Road.md) River and the [Gullik River](../Places/Geographical-Features/Gullik-River.md) to the base of the [Tusk Mountains](../Places/Geographical-Features/Tusk-Mountains.md) and established a new Irriseni province named Rimetusk. She also laid the foundation of the city of [Tashagrot](../Places/Places-of-Interest/Ruins-of-Tashagrot.md) to serve as Rimetusk's provincial capital.
