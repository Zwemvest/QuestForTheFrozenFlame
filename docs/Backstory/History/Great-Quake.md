# Great Quake
In 4433 AR, [Aroden](https://pathfinderwiki.com/wiki/Aroden "Aroden") defeated a cult dedicated to the [../Notions/Demon.md lord](questforthefrozenflame/docs/Backstory/Notions/Demon.md) [Deskari](https://pathfinderwiki.com/wiki/Deskari "Deskari"), driving the survivors into the [Lake of Mists and Veils](https://pathfinderwiki.com/wiki/Lake_of_Mists_and_Veils "Lake of Mists and Veils") and making the north of [Avistan](questforthefrozenflame/docs/Backstory/Places/Avistan.md) safe from [demonic](questforthefrozenflame/docs/Backstory/Notions/Demon.md) influence. This protection ended with Aroden's death in 4606 AR. [Golarion](questforthefrozenflame/docs/Backstory/Places/Golarion.md) moved into alignment with the [Abyss](questforthefrozenflame/docs/Backstory/Places/Abyss.md), and the [Worldwound](questforthefrozenflame/docs/Backstory/Places/Worldwound.md) was opened. This event is refered to, among the [Realm of the Mammoth Lords](questforthefrozenflame/docs/Backstory/Places/Realm-of-the-Mammoth-Lords.md) (and thus the [Broken Tusk](questforthefrozenflame/docs/Backstory/Organizations/Broken-Tusk.md)), as the "Great Quake". 

[Demon](questforthefrozenflame/docs/Backstory/Notions/Demon.md)s poured out, and overran the barbarian nation of [Sarkoris](https://pathfinderwiki.com/wiki/Sarkoris "Sarkoris"). As the [Worldwound](questforthefrozenflame/docs/Backstory/Places/Worldwound.md) grew ever larger, it came to be seen as a threat to the entire world. The remaining clerics of Aroden and the clerics of his follower Iomedae took it upon themselves to defeat the demons and seal the [Worldwound](questforthefrozenflame/docs/Backstory/Places/Worldwound.md). Thus the [Fifth Mendevian Crusade](questforthefrozenflame/docs/Backstory/History/Fifth-Mendevian-Crusade.md) were born.
