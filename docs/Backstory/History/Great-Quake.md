# Great Quake
In 4433 AR, [Aroden](https://pathfinderwiki.com/wiki/Aroden "Aroden") defeated a cult dedicated to the [[demon|demon lord]] [Deskari](https://pathfinderwiki.com/wiki/Deskari "Deskari"), driving the survivors into the [Lake of Mists and Veils](https://pathfinderwiki.com/wiki/Lake_of_Mists_and_Veils "Lake of Mists and Veils") and making the north of [[Avistan]] safe from [[Demon|demonic]] influence. This protection ended with Aroden's death in 4606 AR. [[Golarion]] moved into alignment with the [[Abyss]], and the [[Worldwound]] was opened. This event is refered to, among the [[Realm-of-the-Mammoth-Lords]] (and thus the [[Broken-Tusk|Broken Tusk]]), as the "Great Quake". 

[[Demon|Demons]] poured out, and overran the barbarian nation of [Sarkoris](https://pathfinderwiki.com/wiki/Sarkoris "Sarkoris"). As the [[Worldwound]] grew ever larger, it came to be seen as a threat to the entire world. The remaining clerics of Aroden and the clerics of his follower Iomedae took it upon themselves to defeat the demons and seal the [[Worldwound]]. Thus the [[Fifth-Mendevian-Crusade]] were born.
