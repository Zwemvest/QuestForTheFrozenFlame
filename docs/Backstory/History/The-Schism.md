Though they persevered, the [[Broken-Tusk|Broken Tusk]] now number far fewer than they did in antiquity,  and their place in the world isnâ€™t as certain as it once was. Older [[Broken-Tusk|Broken Tusk]]s use the word [[Ethgir]] to refer to the era before the schism and [[Syorn]] to designate the present period.
