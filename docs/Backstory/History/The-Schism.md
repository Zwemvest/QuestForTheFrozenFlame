# The Schism
The schism that led to the creation of the [Broken Tusk](../Organizations/Broken-Tusk.md) marked a tragic turning point for  the following. Though they persevered, the [Broken Tusk](../Organizations/Broken-Tusk.md) now number far fewer than they did in antiquity,  and their place in the world isnâ€™t as certain as it once was. Older [Broken Tusk](../Organizations/Broken-Tusk.md)s use the word [Ethgir](../Notions/Ethgir.md) to refer to the era before the schism and [Syorn](../Notions/Syorn.md) to designate the present period.
