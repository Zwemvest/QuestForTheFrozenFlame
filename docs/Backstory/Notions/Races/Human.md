# Human
As unpredictable and varied as any of [Golarion](questforthefrozenflame/docs/Backstory/Places/Golarion.md)’s peoples, [human](https://2e.aonprd.com/Ancestries.aspx?ID=6)s have exceptional drive and the capacity to endure and expand. Though many civilizations thrived before humanity rose to prominence, humans have built some of the greatest and the most terrible societies throughout the course of history, and today they are the most populous people in the realms around [Avistan](questforthefrozenflame/docs/Backstory/Places/Avistan.md).  
  
Humans’ ambition, versatility, and exceptional potential have led to their status as the world’s predominant ancestry. Their empires and nations are vast, sprawling things, and their citizens carve names for themselves with the strength of their sword arms and the power of their spells. humanity is diverse and tumultuous, running the gamut from [nomadic](questforthefrozenflame/docs/Backstory/Notions/Kellid.md) to imperial, sinister to saintly. Many of them venture forth to explore, to map the expanse of the multiverse, to search for long-lost treasure, or to lead mighty armies to conquer their neighbors—for no better reason than because they can.

## Notes
[Kellid](questforthefrozenflame/docs/Backstory/Notions/Kellid.md) are the predocuminant group of humans in the [Realm of the Mammoth Lords](questforthefrozenflame/docs/Backstory/Places/Realm-of-the-Mammoth-Lords.md).

[Cali](questforthefrozenflame/docs/Backstory/NPCs/People/Broken-Tusk/Party-Members/Cali.md) is a human. 

## Physical Description
Humans' physical characteristics are as varied as the world's climes. humans have a wide variety of skin and hair colors, body types, and facial features. Generally speaking, their skin has a darker hue the closer to the equator they or their ancestors lived.  
  
Humans reach physical adulthood around the age of 15, though mental maturity occurs a few years later. A typical human can live to be around 90 years old. humans often intermarry with people of other ancestries, giving rise to children who bear the traits of both parents. The most notable half-humans are half-[elves](questforthefrozenflame/docs/Backstory/Notions/Races/Elf.md) and half-[Orcs](questforthefrozenflame/docs/Backstory/Notions/Races/Orc.md).  

## Society
Human variety also manifests in terms of their governments, attitudes, and social norms. Though the oldest of human cultures can trace their shared histories thousands of years into the past, when compared to the societies of the [elves](questforthefrozenflame/docs/Backstory/Notions/Races/Elf.md) or [dwarves](questforthefrozenflame/docs/Backstory/Notions/Races/Dwarf.md), human civilizations seem in a state of constant flux as empires fragment and new kingdoms subsume the old.
