# Halfling
Claiming no place as their own, [halflings](https://2e.aonprd.com/Ancestries.aspx?ID=5) control few settlements larger than villages. Instead, they frequently live among [human](questforthefrozenflame/docs/Backstory/Notions/Races/Human.md)s within the walls of larger cities, carving out small communities alongside taller folk. Many halflings lead perfectly fulfilling lives in the shadows of their larger neighbors, while others prefer a nomadic existence, traveling the world and taking advantage of opportunities and adventures as they come.

Optimistic and cheerful, blessed with uncanny luck, and driven by powerful wanderlust, halflings make up for their short stature with an abundance of bravado and curiosity. At once excitable and easygoing, they are the best kind of opportunists, and their passions favor joy over violence. Even in the jaws of danger, halflings rarely lose their sense of humor.

Many taller people dismiss halflings due to their size or, worse, treat them like children. halflings use these prejudices and misconceptions to their advantage, gaining access to opportunities and performing deeds of daring mischief or heroism. A halfling’s curiosity is tempered by wisdom and caution, leading to calculated risks and narrow escapes.

While their wanderlust and curiosity sometimes drive them toward adventure, halflings also carry strong ties to [house](questforthefrozenflame/docs/Backstory/Notions/House.md) and home, often spending above their means to achieve comfort in their homelife.

## Notes
[Willow](questforthefrozenflame/docs/Backstory/Party-Members/Willow.md) is a halfling. 

## Physical Description
Halflings are short humanoids who look vaguely like smaller [human](questforthefrozenflame/docs/Backstory/Notions/Races/Human.md)s. They rarely grow to be more than 3 feet in height. halfling proportions vary, with some looking like shorter adult [human](questforthefrozenflame/docs/Backstory/Notions/Races/Human.md)s with slightly larger heads and others having proportions closer to those of a [human](questforthefrozenflame/docs/Backstory/Notions/Races/Human.md) child.  
  
Most halflings prefer to walk barefoot rather than wearing shoes, and those who do so develop roughly calloused soles on their feet over time. Tufts of thick, often-curly hair warm the tops of their broad, tanned feet. halfling skin tones tend toward rich, tawny shades like amber or oak, and their hair color ranges from a light golden blond to raven black.  
  
Halflings reach physical adulthood around the age of 20. A typical halfling can live to be around 150 years old.  

## Society
Despite their jovial and friendly nature, halflings don’t usually tend to congregate. They have no cultural homeland in the Inner Sea region, and they instead weave themselves throughout the societies of the world. halflings eke out whatever living they can manage, many performing menial labor or holding simple service jobs. Some halflings reject city life, instead turning to the open road and traveling from place to place in search of fortune and fame. These nomadic halflings often travel in small groups, sharing hardships and simple pleasures among close friends and family.  
  
Wherever halflings go, they seamlessly blend into the society they find themselves in, adapting to the culture of the predominant ancestry around them and adding their uniquely halfling twists, creating a blend of cultural diffusion that enriches both cultures.
