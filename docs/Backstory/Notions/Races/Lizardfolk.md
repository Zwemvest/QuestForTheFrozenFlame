# Lizardfolk
*Xiat's note: Other races sometimes use the term "Lizardfolk", but amongst ourselves we call ourselves  we call ourselves "Iruxi". For the clarity of whomever may read this, I'll refer to our ancestry as "Lizardfolk". Lizardfolk is both singular and plural.*

[Lizardfolk](https://2e.aonprd.com/Ancestries.aspx?ID=15) move through the societies of other humanoids with the steely reserve of born predators. They have a well-deserved reputation as outstanding rangers and unsentimental fighters. Though Lizardfolk have adapted to many different environments, many of them still prefer to remain near bodies of water, using their ability to hold their breath to their advantage. As a result, Lizardfolk usually prefer equipment that is not easily damaged by moisture, eschewing leather and metal for gear made of stone, ivory, glass, and bone.

Lizardfolk are consummate survivors, heirs to empires considered ancient even by the [[elf|elves]].

## Notes
Lizardfolk are very rare in the [[Realm-of-the-Mammoth-Lords]], generally preferring warmer climates. 

[[Xiat]] is a Lizardfolk, though outcast from Lizardfolk society

## Physical Description
Lizardfolk vary depending on their environment, but share toothy snouts and long and powerful tails. Those from temperate or desert regions tend toward gray, green, or brown scales that aid in camouflage, while those from tropical climes are brightly colored. Many sport dorsal spikes or garish neck frills that hint at their clan lineage. Lizardfolk reach physical adulthood at age 15 and live up to 120 years. The average Lizardfolk stands 6 to 7 feet tall, but grows throughout their lifetime, gaining strength and size with age.

## Society
Known among themselves as iruxi, Lizardfolk are raised communally from the moment they break from their shells. They have an oral tradition stretching back thousands of years, brought to life through epic poems, evocative carvings, and ancestral rites performed among fields of fossilized bone. Lizardfolk are passionate astrologers with one eye on the future. If they seem slow to act, it is because their long history has taught them the value of patience.  
  
The simple villages most outsiders associate with iruxi are the homes of migrants in outlying regions. True iruxi settlements are often overlooked, as they are partially or mostly submerged in water. These glass and stone complexes bear the mark of every generation of Lizardfolk that lived within them, and Lizardfolk bones often adorn the walls, as many Lizardfolk believe these remains can be animated by ancestral spirits when the residents are in danger.
