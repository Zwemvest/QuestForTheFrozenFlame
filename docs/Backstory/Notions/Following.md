# Following 
In the [[Realm-of-the-Mammoth-Lords|Realm of the Mammoth Lords]],  followings are the predominant social structure. Most followings, including the [[Broken-Tusk|Broken Tusk]], migrate across the land in tandem with the regionâ€™s native fauna and  are led by strong, wise leaders called [[Mammoth-Lord|Mammoth Lord]]s.

*[[Xiat]]'s note: our following is the [[Broken-Tusk|Broken Tusk]]. But I guess I form a pretty neat following with [[Kaska]], [[Willow]], and [[Cali]] too.*
