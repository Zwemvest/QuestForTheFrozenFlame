# Tian People
![Tian.png](questforthefrozenflame/docs/Images/Monsters/Tian.png)
The [Tian](https://pathfinderwiki.com/wiki/Tian_(human_ethnicity)) (pronounced TEE-yawn) people come from the distant continent of Tian Xia, located far to the east of [Avistan](questforthefrozenflame/docs/Backstory/Places/Avistan.md). The few Tian who migrate from their homeland to the shores of [Avistan](questforthefrozenflame/docs/Backstory/Places/Avistan.md) are generally classed as a single ethnicity. The Tian people, however, come from an entire continent, and as such are not one united ethnicity, but many different ones. All Tian in [Avistan](questforthefrozenflame/docs/Backstory/Places/Avistan.md), however, have one thing in common: they are thousands upon thousands of miles from their ancestral homeland.
