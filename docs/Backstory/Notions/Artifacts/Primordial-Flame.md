# Primordial Flame
A legendary artifact, created by the [[Kellid]] goddess [Sister Cinder](Sister-Cinder) to lead her [believers](Burning-Mammoth) out of the Age of Darkness. It is the source of our [former tribe](Original-Burning-Mammoth)'s name, and considered the sacred birthright of our tribe.

During the [Fifth Crusade](Fifth-Mendevian-Crusade#Fifth Mendevian Crusade (4713–4718 AR)), parts of our tribe split during [The Schism](The-Schism). The [Burning Mammoth](Burning-Mammoth) went to fight [[Demon]]s in the east, and the remainder took the Primordial Flame and hid it. Since then, the rebels who took the flame call themselves the [Broken Tusk](Broken-Tusk), our tribe.

[Grandfather Eiwa](Grandfather-Eiwa) explained this to us on the [Evening of 28 Calistril 4072](Session-2#Evening of 28 Calistril 4072)
