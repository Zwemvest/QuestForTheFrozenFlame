# Primordial Flame
A legendary artifact, created by the [[Kellid]] goddess [[Sister-Cinder]] to lead her [[Burning-Mammoth|believers]] out of the Age of Darkness. It is the source of our [[Original-Burning-Mammoth|former tribe]]'s name, and considered the sacred birthright of our tribe.

During the [[Fifth-Mendevian-Crusade#Fifth Mendevian Crusade (4713â€“4718 AR)|Fifth Crusade]], parts of our tribe split during [[The-Schism]]. The [[Burning-Mammoth]] went to fight [[Demon]]s in the east, and the remainder took the Primordial Flame and hid it. Since then, the rebels who took the flame call themselves the [[Broken-Tusk|Broken Tusk]], our tribe.

[[Grandfather-Eiwa]] explained this to us on the [[Session-2#Evening of 28 Calistril 4072|Evening of 28 Calistril 4072]]
