# Primordial Flame
A legendary artifact, created by the [Kellid](../Kellid.md) goddess [Sister Cinder](../../NPCs/Deities/Sister-Cinder.md) to lead her [believers](../../Organizations/Burning-Mammoth.md) out of the Age of Darkness. It is the source of our [former tribe](../../Organizations/Original-Burning-Mammoth.md)'s name, and considered the sacred birthright of our tribe.

During the [Fifth Mendevian Crusade](../../History/Fifth-Mendevian-Crusade.md), parts of our tribe split during [The Schism](../../History/The-Schism.md). The [Burning Mammoth](../../Organizations/Burning-Mammoth.md) went to fight [Demon](../Demon.md)s in the east, and the remainder took the Primordial Flame and hid it. Since then, the rebels who took the flame call themselves the [Broken Tusk](../../Organizations/Broken-Tusk.md), our tribe.

[Grandfather Eiwa](../../NPCs/Broken-Tusk/Grandfather-Eiwa.md) explained this to us on the [Evening of 28 Calistril 4072](../../../Playing-Notes/Session-2.md#Evening%20of%2028%20Calistril%204072)
