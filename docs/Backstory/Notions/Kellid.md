# Kellid People
![Amiri.png](questforthefrozenflame/docs/Images/Monsters/Amiri.png)
The original natives of most of [Avistan](questforthefrozenflame/docs/Backstory/Places/Avistan.md) before the spread of the Taldan Empire, the [Kellid](https://pathfinderwiki.com/wiki/Kellid)s pronounced KEHL-ids) represent what every resident of the continent thinks of when they refer to barbarians". [Sandwiched between an empire of orc](questforthefrozenflame/docs/Backstory/Places/Hold-of-Belkzen.md)s, marauding demons of the [Worldwound](questforthefrozenflame/docs/Backstory/Places/Worldwound.md), and the witch-haunted kingdom of [Irrisen](questforthefrozenflame/docs/Backstory/Places/Irrisen.md), Kellids are a pragmatic product of their harsh environment and direct descendants of a more savage age. Kellids in northern [Avistan](questforthefrozenflame/docs/Backstory/Places/Avistan.md) cling tightly to their traditional ways.
