# Kellid People
![Amiri.png](Amiri.png)
The original natives of most of [Avistan](Avistan) before the spread of the Taldan Empire, the [Kellid](https://pathfinderwiki.com/wiki/Kellid)s pronounced KEHL-ids) represent what every resident of the continent thinks of when they refer to barbarians". [Sandwiched between an empire of orc](Hold-of-Belkzen)s, marauding demons of the [Worldwound](Worldwound), and the witch-haunted kingdom of [Irrisen](Irrisen), Kellids are a pragmatic product of their harsh environment and direct descendants of a more savage age. Kellids in northern [Avistan](Avistan) cling tightly to their traditional ways.
