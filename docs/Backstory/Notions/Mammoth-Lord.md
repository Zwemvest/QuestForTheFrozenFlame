# Mammoth Lord
The leaders of [following](questforthefrozenflame/docs/Backstory/Notions/Following.md)s are called [Mammoth](questforthefrozenflame/docs/Backstory/NPCs/Fauna/Mammoth.md) Lords. Typically, only the strongest and bravest members of a following can hope to attain this honored role, and only after they have proven themselves by taming and training a megafauna mount such as a woolly [mammoth](questforthefrozenflame/docs/Backstory/NPCs/Fauna/Mammoth.md), saber-toothed tiger, or cave bear.

The [Broken Tusk](questforthefrozenflame/docs/Backstory/Organizations/Broken-Tusk.md) is led by five [Mammoth](questforthefrozenflame/docs/Backstory/NPCs/Fauna/Mammoth.md) Lords: [Argakoa the Songsinger](questforthefrozenflame/docs/Backstory/NPCs/Broken-Tusk/Argakoa-the-Songsinger.md), her dour but willful husband [Letsua](questforthefrozenflame/docs/Backstory/NPCs/Broken-Tusk/Letsua.md), [Merthig the Firekeeper](questforthefrozenflame/docs/Backstory/NPCs/Broken-Tusk/Merthig-the-Firekeeper.md), [Nakta the Healer](questforthefrozenflame/docs/Backstory/NPCs/Broken-Tusk/Nakta-the-Healer.md), and wise old [Grandfather Eiwa](questforthefrozenflame/docs/Backstory/NPCs/Broken-Tusk/Grandfather-Eiwa.md).
