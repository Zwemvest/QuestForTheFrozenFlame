# Mammoth Lord
The leaders of [following](following)s are called [Mammoth](Mammoth) Lords. Typically, only the strongest and bravest members of a following can hope to attain this honored role, and only after they have proven themselves by taming and training a megafauna mount such as a woolly [mammoth](mammoth), saber-toothed tiger, or cave bear.

The [Broken Tusk](Broken-Tusk) is led by five [Mammoth](Mammoth) Lords: [Argakoa the Songsinger](Argakoa-the-Songsinger), her dour but willful husband [Letsua](Letsua), [Merthig the Firekeeper](Merthig-the-Firekeeper), [Nakta the Healer](Nakta-the-Healer), and wise old [Grandfather Eiwa](Grandfather-Eiwa).
