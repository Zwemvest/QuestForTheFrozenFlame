# Hallit
This harsh, guttural tongue spoken in rapid staccato is native to the the [Kellid](questforthefrozenflame/docs/Backstory/Notions/Kellid.md) people originally from the north of [Avistan](questforthefrozenflame/docs/Backstory/Places/Avistan.md), and centers around survival and war. Although many northern barbarian tribes use versions of Hallit that have no written form, a written form does exist.

It is the language spoken by nearly every person, indigenous or otherwise, in the [Realm of the Mammoth Lords](questforthefrozenflame/docs/Backstory/Places/Realm-of-the-Mammoth-Lords.md).
