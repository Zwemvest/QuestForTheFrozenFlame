# Hallit
This harsh, guttural tongue spoken in rapid staccato is native to the the [Kellid](Kellid) people originally from the north of [Avistan](Avistan), and centers around survival and war. Although many northern barbarian tribes use versions of Hallit that have no written form, a written form does exist.

It is the language spoken by nearly every person, indigenous or otherwise, in the [Realm of the Mammoth Lords](Realm-of-the-Mammoth-Lords).
