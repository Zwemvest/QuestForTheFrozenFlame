# Hallit
This harsh, guttural tongue spoken in rapid staccato is native to the the Kellid people originally from the north of Avistan, and centers around survival and war. Although many northern barbarian tribes use versions of Hallit that have no written form, a written form does exist.

It is the language spoken by nearly every person, indigenous or otherwise, in the [[Realm_of_the_Mammoth_Lords]].
