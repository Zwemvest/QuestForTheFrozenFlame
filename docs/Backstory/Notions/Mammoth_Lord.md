# Mammoth Lord

The leaders of [[Following]]s are called Mammoth Lords. Typically, only the strongest and bravest members of a following can hope to attain this honored role, and only after they have proven themselves by taming and training a megafauna mount such as a woolly mammoth, saber-toothed tiger, or cave bear.

The [[Broken_Tusk]] is led by five Mammoth Lords: [[Argakoa_the_Songsinger]], her dour but willful husband [[Letsua]], [[Merthig_the_Firekeeper]], [[Nakta_the_Healer]], and wise old [[Grandfather_Eiwa]].
