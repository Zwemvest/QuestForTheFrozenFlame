# Shape Stone
Shape stone is a spell that allows a caster to manipulate stones. They can shape the stone into a rough shape of their choice. The shaping process is too crude to produce intricate parts, fine details, moving pieces, or the like. Any creatures standing atop the stone when you reshape it must each attempt a Reflex save or Acrobatics check.
