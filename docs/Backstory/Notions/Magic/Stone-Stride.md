# Stone Stride
Stone Stride is a spell that allows a caster to move through stones. It is a special ability of [[korred]]s. The korred steps into a block of stone large enough for them to fit inside and instantly teleports to any other stone within 30 feet that has the same minimum size. Once the [[korred]] enters the stone, they instantly know the rough locations of other sufficiently large stones within 30 feet. They can exit from the original stone, if they prefer. 

[[Shaggy-Shemven|Shaggy Shemven]] can shape stones.
