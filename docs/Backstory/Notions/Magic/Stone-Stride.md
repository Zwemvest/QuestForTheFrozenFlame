# Stone Stride
Stone Stride is a spell that allows a caster to move through stones. It is a special ability of [korred](questforthefrozenflame/docs/Backstory/NPCs/Monsters/Korred.md)s. The korred steps into a block of stone large enough for them to fit inside and instantly teleports to any other stone within 30 feet that has the same minimum size. Once the [korred](questforthefrozenflame/docs/Backstory/NPCs/Monsters/Korred.md) enters the stone, they instantly know the rough locations of other sufficiently large stones within 30 feet. They can exit from the original stone, if they prefer. 

[Shaggy Shemven](questforthefrozenflame/docs/Backstory/NPCs/Broken-Tusk/Shaggy-Shemven.md) can shape stones.
