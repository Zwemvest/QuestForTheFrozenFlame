When a sinful mortal soul is judged and sent on to the [[Abyss]], it can become a deadly fiend—a demon. Demons are living incarnations of sin—be they classic sins like wrath or gluttony, or more “specialized” depravities like an obsession with torture or the act of treason or treachery. Once formed, a demon’s driving goals are twofold—the amassing of personal power, and the corruption of mortal souls to cause them to become tainted by sin. In this way demons ensure a never-ending supply of new demons to bolster their ever-growing ranks in the [[Abyss]].

Native to the [[Abyss]], demons cannot easily make the journey to the Material Plane. Nevertheless, they can be found wherever powerful evil spellcasters summon them to bring harm upon their enemies. There are only two known locations in the [[Avistan|Inner Sea region]], however, where demons are common and seem to be growing in numbers: the Tanglebriar in Kyonin and the [[Worldwound]].
