# Broken Tusk
**Full name: Banner of the Broken Tusk**
Though those who call themselves “Broken Tusks” can [[Original-Broken-Tusk|trace their lineage back thousands of years]], the banner of the Broken Tusk itself —which symbolizes the values of its followers— is fairly new. 

Six generations ago, a terrible evil crawled from the earth and threatened the land. To stave off this evil, a few [[Broken-Tusk-Rebels|rebellious members]] of one following made a great sacrifice. The other members, feeling betrayed, took their banner with them, [[The_Schism|forcing the rebels who remained to make a new name and identity for themselves]]. To symbolize their perseverance in the face of overwhelming odds, the rebels called themselves the Broken Tusk.

The [[Broken-Tusk]] deity is [[Sister_Cinder]]. The Broken Tusk [[following]] numbers 74.

Throughout most of its history, the Broken Tusk and [[The_Schism|their predecessors]] consisted primarily of [[Kellid|Kellid]] humans native to the Realm of the Mammoth Lords. Since the [[following]] began actively recruiting new followers, however, the ancestral makeup of the Broken Tusk has expanded to include many different types of people commonly found in northern Avistan. While [[Kellid|Kellid]]  still make up the majority of the following, the group currently also boasts a number of Ilverani elves and Snowborn half-elves, Ergaksen and Holtaksen dwarves, and Belkzen half-orcs.

The Broken Tusk is led by five [[Mammoth_Lord]]s: [[Argakoa_the_Songsinger]], her dour but willful husband [[Letsua]], [[Merthig_the_Firekeeper]], [[Nakta_the_Healer]], and wise old [[Grandfather_Eiwa]]. Of the five, Argakoa and Eiwa have filled their roles longest, followed by Merthig, Nakta, and Letsua.

At the outset of the Quest for the Frozen Flame Adventure Path, head scout [[Wipa]] has taken your party under her wing and is training you to become the next generation of great Broken Tusk scouts. Along with you, she is training [[Pakano]], the great-grandson of Eiwa’s late sister and heir apparent of [[Falcon-House]].

*Xiat's Note: This is our tribe! Some of my friends have spent their entire lives with the tribe, like Kaska and Willow. I only joined fairly recently.*
