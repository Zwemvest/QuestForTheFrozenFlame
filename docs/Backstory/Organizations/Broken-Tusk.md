# Broken Tusk
**Full name: Banner of the Broken Tusk**
Though those who call themselves “Broken Tusks” can [trace their lineage back thousands of years](Original-Burning-Mammoth), the banner of the Broken Tusk itself —which symbolizes the values of its followers— is fairly new. 

Six generations ago, a terrible evil crawled from the earth and threatened the land. To stave off this evil, a few rebellious members of one following made a great sacrifice. The other members, feeling betrayed, took their banner with them, [forcing the rebels who remained to make a new name and identity for themselves](The-Schism). To symbolize their perseverance in the face of overwhelming odds, the rebels called themselves the Broken Tusk.

The [Broken Tusk](Broken-Tusk) deity is [Sister Cinder](Sister-Cinder). The Broken Tusk [following](following) numbers 74.

Throughout most of its history, the Broken Tusk and [their predecessors](The-Schism) consisted primarily of [Kellid](Kellid) [human](human)s native to the [Realm of the Mammoth Lords](Realm-of-the-Mammoth-Lords). Since the [following](following) began actively recruiting new followers, however, the ancestral makeup of the Broken Tusk has expanded to include many different types of people commonly found in northern [Avistan](Avistan). While [Kellid](Kellid)  still make up the majority of the following, the group currently also boasts a number of Ilverani elves and Snowborn half-elves, Ergaksen and Holtaksen dwarves, and [Belkzen](Hold-of-Belkzen) half-orcs.

The Broken Tusk is led by five [Mammoth Lord](Mammoth-Lord)s: [Argakoa the Songsinger](Argakoa-the-Songsinger), her dour but willful husband [Letsua](Letsua), [Merthig the Firekeeper](Merthig-the-Firekeeper), [Nakta the Healer](Nakta-the-Healer), and wise old [Grandfather Eiwa](Grandfather-Eiwa). Of the five, [Argakoa](Argakoa-the-Songsinger) and [Eiwa](Grandfather-Eiwa) have filled their roles longest, followed by [Merthig](Merthig-the-Firekeeper), [Nakta](Nakta-the-Healer), and [Letsua](Letsua).

At the outset of the Quest for the Frozen Flame Adventure Path, head scout [Wipa](Wipa) has taken your party under her wing and is training you to become the next generation of great Broken Tusk scouts. Along with you, she is training [Pakano](Pakano), the great-grandson of [Eiwa](Grandfather-Eiwa)’s late sister and heir apparent of [Falcon House](Falcon-House).

*[Xiat](Xiat)'s Note: This is our tribe! Some of my friends have spent their entire lives with the tribe, like [Kaska](Kaska) and [Willow](Willow). I only joined fairly recently.*
