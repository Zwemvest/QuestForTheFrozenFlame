# Broken Tusk
**Full name: Banner of the Broken Tusk**
Though those who call themselves “Broken Tusks” can [trace their lineage back thousands of years](questforthefrozenflame/docs/Backstory/Organizations/Original-Burning-Mammoth.md), the banner of the Broken Tusk itself —which symbolizes the values of its followers— is fairly new. 

Six generations ago, a terrible evil crawled from the earth and threatened the land. To stave off this evil, a few rebellious members of one following made a great sacrifice. The other members, feeling betrayed, took their banner with them, [forcing the rebels who remained to make a new name and identity for themselves](questforthefrozenflame/docs/Backstory/History/The-Schism.md). To symbolize their perseverance in the face of overwhelming odds, the rebels called themselves the Broken Tusk.

The [Broken Tusk](questforthefrozenflame/docs/Backstory/Organizations/Broken-Tusk.md) deity is [Sister Cinder](questforthefrozenflame/docs/Backstory/NPCs/Deities/Sister-Cinder.md). The Broken Tusk [following](questforthefrozenflame/docs/Backstory/Notions/Following.md) numbers 74.

Throughout most of its history, the Broken Tusk and [their predecessors](questforthefrozenflame/docs/Backstory/History/The-Schism.md) consisted primarily of [Kellid](questforthefrozenflame/docs/Backstory/Notions/Kellid.md) [human](questforthefrozenflame/docs/Backstory/Notions/Races/Human.md)s native to the [Realm of the Mammoth Lords](questforthefrozenflame/docs/Backstory/Places/Realm-of-the-Mammoth-Lords.md). Since the [following](questforthefrozenflame/docs/Backstory/Notions/Following.md) began actively recruiting new followers, however, the ancestral makeup of the Broken Tusk has expanded to include many different types of people commonly found in northern [Avistan](questforthefrozenflame/docs/Backstory/Places/Avistan.md). While [Kellid](questforthefrozenflame/docs/Backstory/Notions/Kellid.md)  still make up the majority of the following, the group currently also boasts a number of Ilverani elves and Snowborn half-elves, Ergaksen and Holtaksen dwarves, and [Belkzen](questforthefrozenflame/docs/Backstory/Places/Hold-of-Belkzen.md) half-orcs.

The Broken Tusk is led by five [Mammoth Lord](questforthefrozenflame/docs/Backstory/Notions/Mammoth-Lord.md)s: [Argakoa the Songsinger](questforthefrozenflame/docs/Backstory/NPCs/Broken-Tusk/Argakoa-the-Songsinger.md), her dour but willful husband [Letsua](questforthefrozenflame/docs/Backstory/NPCs/Broken-Tusk/Letsua.md), [Merthig the Firekeeper](questforthefrozenflame/docs/Backstory/NPCs/Broken-Tusk/Merthig-the-Firekeeper.md), [Nakta the Healer](questforthefrozenflame/docs/Backstory/NPCs/Broken-Tusk/Nakta-the-Healer.md), and wise old [Grandfather Eiwa](questforthefrozenflame/docs/Backstory/NPCs/Broken-Tusk/Grandfather-Eiwa.md). Of the five, [Argakoa](questforthefrozenflame/docs/Backstory/NPCs/Broken-Tusk/Argakoa-the-Songsinger.md) and [Eiwa](questforthefrozenflame/docs/Backstory/NPCs/Broken-Tusk/Grandfather-Eiwa.md) have filled their roles longest, followed by [Merthig](questforthefrozenflame/docs/Backstory/NPCs/Broken-Tusk/Merthig-the-Firekeeper.md), [Nakta](questforthefrozenflame/docs/Backstory/NPCs/Broken-Tusk/Nakta-the-Healer.md), and [Letsua](questforthefrozenflame/docs/Backstory/NPCs/Broken-Tusk/Letsua.md).

At the outset of the Quest for the Frozen Flame Adventure Path, head scout [Wipa](questforthefrozenflame/docs/Backstory/NPCs/Broken-Tusk/Wipa.md) has taken your party under her wing and is training you to become the next generation of great Broken Tusk scouts. Along with you, she is training [Pakano](questforthefrozenflame/docs/Backstory/NPCs/Broken-Tusk/Pakano.md), the great-grandson of [Eiwa](questforthefrozenflame/docs/Backstory/NPCs/Broken-Tusk/Grandfather-Eiwa.md)’s late sister and heir apparent of [Falcon House](questforthefrozenflame/docs/Backstory/Organizations/Falcon-House.md).

*[Xiat](questforthefrozenflame/docs/Backstory/Party-Members/Xiat.md)'s Note: This is our tribe! Some of my friends have spent their entire lives with the tribe, like [Kaska](questforthefrozenflame/docs/Backstory/Party-Members/Kaska.md) and [Willow](questforthefrozenflame/docs/Backstory/Party-Members/Willow.md). I only joined fairly recently.*
