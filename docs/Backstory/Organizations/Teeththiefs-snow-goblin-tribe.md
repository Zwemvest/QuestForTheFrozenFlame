# Teeththief's Snow Goblin Tribe
This is [Teeththief](questforthefrozenflame/docs/Backstory/Party-Members/Teeththief.md)'s [Goblin](questforthefrozenflame/docs/Backstory/Notions/Races/Goblin.md) tribe, but they've banished her long before we came to know her. She kept stealing the teeth of her fellow [Goblin](questforthefrozenflame/docs/Backstory/Notions/Races/Goblin.md)s. 

Snow [Goblin](questforthefrozenflame/docs/Backstory/Notions/Races/Goblin.md)s are acclimated to living in frigid lands and have skin ranging from sky blue to navy in color, as well as blue fur.
