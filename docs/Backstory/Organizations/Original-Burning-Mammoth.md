# Original Burning Mammoth
Before the [Great Quake](../History/Great-Quake.md), the [Burning Mammoth](Burning-Mammoth.md) and [Broken Tusk](Broken-Tusk.md) used to be a single tribe, also called the [Burning Mammoth](Burning-Mammoth.md) Tribe, named after the [Primordial Flame](../Notions/Artifacts/Primordial-Flame.md) (and their plentiful [Mammoth](../NPCs/Fauna/Mammoth.md)s, of course)

However, six generations ago, a [terrible evil](../Notions/Demon.md) [crawled from the earth](../History/Great-Quake.md) and threatened the land. To stave off this evil, a [few rebellious members](Broken-Tusk.md) of one [following](../Notions/Following.md) made a great sacrifice. The other members, feeling betrayed, took their banner with them, [forcing the rebels who remained to make a new name and identity for themselves](../History/The-Schism.md). To symbolize their perseverance in the face of overwhelming odds, the rebels called themselves the [Broken Tusk](Broken-Tusk.md). The rest of the tribe went on as the [Burning Mammoth](Burning-Mammoth.md)s, in this document refered to as the [Burning Mammoth](Burning-Mammoth.md). 

[Grandfather Eiwa](../NPCs/Broken-Tusk/Grandfather-Eiwa.md) remembers the [Burning Mammoth](../../../../..//questforthefrozenflame/docs/Backstory/Organizations/Original-Burning-Mammoth.md) from before the [The Schism](../History/The-Schism.md). He explained our history on [Evening of 28 Calistril 4072](../../Playing-Notes/Session-2.md#Evening%20of%2028%20Calistril%204072).
