# Original Burning Mammoth
Before the [[Great-Quake]], the [[Burning-Mammoth]] and [[Broken-Tusk]] used to be a single tribe, also called the Burning Mammoth Tribe, named after the [[Primordial-Flame]] (and their plentiful [[Mammoth]]s, of course)

However, six generations ago, a [[Demon|terrible evil]] [[Great-Quake|crawled from the earth]] and threatened the land. To stave off this evil, a [[Broken-Tusk|few rebellious members]] of one [[following]] made a great sacrifice. The other members, feeling betrayed, took their banner with them, [[The-Schism|forcing the rebels who remained to make a new name and identity for themselves]]. To symbolize their perseverance in the face of overwhelming odds, the rebels called themselves the [[Broken-Tusk]]. The rest of the tribe went on as the [[Burning-Mammoth|Burning Mammoth]]s, in this document refered to as the [[Burning-Mammoth]]. 

[[Grandfather-Eiwa]] remembers the [[Original-Burning-Mammoth|Burning Mammoth]] from before the [[The-Schism]]. He explained our history on [[Session-2#Evening of 28 Calistril 4072|Evening of 28 Calistril 4072]].
