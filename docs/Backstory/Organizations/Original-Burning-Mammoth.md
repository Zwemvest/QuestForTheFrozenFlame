# Original Burning Mammoth
Before the [Great Quake](Great-Quake), the [Burning Mammoth](Burning-Mammoth) and [Broken Tusk](Broken-Tusk) used to be a single tribe, also called the [Burning Mammoth](Burning-Mammoth) Tribe, named after the [Primordial Flame](Primordial-Flame) (and their plentiful [[Mammoth]]s, of course)

However, six generations ago, a [terrible evil](Demon) [crawled from the earth](Great-Quake) and threatened the land. To stave off this evil, a [few rebellious members](Broken-Tusk) of one [[following]] made a great sacrifice. The other members, feeling betrayed, took their banner with them, [forcing the rebels who remained to make a new name and identity for themselves](The-Schism). To symbolize their perseverance in the face of overwhelming odds, the rebels called themselves the [Broken Tusk](Broken-Tusk). The rest of the tribe went on as the [Burning Mammoth](Burning-Mammoth)s, in this document refered to as the [Burning Mammoth](Burning-Mammoth). 

[Grandfather Eiwa](Grandfather-Eiwa) remembers the [Burning Mammoth](Original-Burning-Mammoth) from before the [The Schism](The-Schism). He explained our history on [Evening of 28 Calistril 4072](Session-2#Evening of 28 Calistril 4072).
