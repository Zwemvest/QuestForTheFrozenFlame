# Broken Tusk Rebels
**Full name: unknown**
Six generations ago, a terrible evil crawled from the earth and threatened the land. To stave off this evil, a few rebellious members of one following made a great sacrifice. The other members, feeling betrayed, took their banner with them, [[The_Schism|forcing the rebels who remained to make a new name and identity for themselves]]. To symbolize their perseverance in the face of overwhelming odds, the rebels called themselves the [[Broken-Tusk]].

We met two warriors from this tribe in [[Session_1#30 Abadius 4072|30 Abadius 4072]]. They claimed that the Tapirs we tried to tame for our tribe were theirs. We fought them, after which one of them fled, and the other one died shortly after we interrogated him. Before he died, he mentioned that his tribe were "the most powerful [[following]] west of the [[Tusk-Mountains]]".
