# Moose House
One of the [[House]]s of the [[Broken-Tusk|Broken Tusk]] tribe. [[House]] members spend most of their time with one another, sharing duties, forming friend groups, and occupying the same communal sleeping tent. [[House]]s are typically represented by animals who individually embody courage, cleverness, and resilience. [[Broken-Tusk|Broken Tusk]] typically identify themselves with just one of the animals represented in their [[house]], and their personal effects often feature that animal.

Headed by [[Nakta-the-Healer]].

The [[house]] is represented by **bears and ravens**.
