# Icerender Tribe
The [Icerender tribe](https://pathfinderwiki.com/wiki/Icerender_tribe) is a kobold tribe that lives in a pass in the [Tusk Mountains](questforthefrozenflame/docs/Backstory/Places/Geographical-Features/Tusk-Mountains.md). The kobolds work tirelessly to keep the pass open. A lot of caravans use that mountain pass in order to avoid the attacks of the white dragon [Lydek the White](questforthefrozenflame/docs/Backstory/NPCs/Monsters/Invidivuals/Lydek-the-White.md) in the south. The kobolds sporadically attack and loot the caravans and then they dispose of the remnants of them. A large part of the loot the kobolds obtain, is offered to [Lydek the White](questforthefrozenflame/docs/Backstory/NPCs/Monsters/Invidivuals/Lydek-the-White.md) as a tribute.
