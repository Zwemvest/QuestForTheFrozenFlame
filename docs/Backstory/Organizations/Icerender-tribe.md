# Icerender Tribe
The [Icerender tribe](https://pathfinderwiki.com/wiki/Icerender_tribe) is a kobold tribe that lives in a pass in the [[Tusk-Mountains|Tusk Mountains]]. The kobolds work tirelessly to keep the pass open. A lot of caravans use that mountain pass in order to avoid the attacks of the white dragon [[Lydek-the-White|Lydek the White]] in the south. The kobolds sporadically attack and loot the caravans and then they dispose of the remnants of them. A large part of the loot the kobolds obtain, is offered to [[Lydek-the-White|Lydek the White]] as a tribute.
