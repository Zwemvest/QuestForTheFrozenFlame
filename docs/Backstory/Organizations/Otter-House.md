# Otter House
One of the [House](../Notions/House.md)s of the [Broken Tusk](Broken-Tusk.md) tribe. [House](../Notions/House.md) members spend most of their time with one another, sharing duties, forming friend groups, and occupying the same communal sleeping tent. [House](../Notions/House.md)s are typically represented by animals who individually embody courage, cleverness, and resilience. [Broken Tusk](Broken-Tusk.md) typically identify themselves with just one of the animals represented in their [house](../Notions/House.md), and their personal effects often feature that animal.

Headed by [Argakoa the Songsinger](../NPCs/Broken-Tusk/Argakoa-the-Songsinger.md).
