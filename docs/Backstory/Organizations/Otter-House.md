# Otter House
One of the [[House]]s of the [Broken Tusk](Broken-Tusk) tribe. [[House]] members spend most of their time with one another, sharing duties, forming friend groups, and occupying the same communal sleeping tent. [[House]]s are typically represented by animals who individually embody courage, cleverness, and resilience. [Broken Tusk](Broken-Tusk) typically identify themselves with just one of the animals represented in their [[house]], and their personal effects often feature that animal.

Headed by [Argakoa the Songsinger](Argakoa-the-Songsinger).
