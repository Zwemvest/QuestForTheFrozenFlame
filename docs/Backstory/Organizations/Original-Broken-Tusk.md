# Original Broken Tusk
**Full name: unknown**
Six generations ago, a terrible evil crawled from the earth and threatened the land. To stave off this evil, a few [[Broken-Tusk-Rebels|rebellious members]] of one following made a great sacrifice. The other members, feeling betrayed, took their banner with them, [[The_Schism|forcing the rebels who remained to make a new name and identity for themselves]]. To symbolize their perseverance in the face of overwhelming odds, the rebels called themselves the [[Broken-Tusk]].
