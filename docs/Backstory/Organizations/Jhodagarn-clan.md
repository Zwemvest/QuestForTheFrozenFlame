# Jhodagarn clan
Jhodagarn clan is a clan of [[Frost-Giant]]s, who make their home in the [[Tusk-Mountains]] in the [[Realm-of-the-Mammoth-Lords]]. The clan moved into the area in the mid-47th century AR, slaughtering the local [[Kellid]] tribes and taking control of one of their holy sites: the [[Mountain-of-Frozen-Echoes]]. 

They are ruled by [[Jarl-Yensiir-Rimeblood]].
