# Jhodagarn clan
Jhodagarn clan is a clan of [Frost Giant](../NPCs/Monsters/Frost-Giant.md)s, who make their home in the [Tusk Mountains](../Places/Geographical-Features/Tusk-Mountains.md) in the [Realm of the Mammoth Lords](../Places/Realm-of-the-Mammoth-Lords.md). The clan moved into the area in the mid-47th century AR, slaughtering the local [Kellid](../Notions/Kellid.md) tribes and taking control of one of their holy sites: the [Mountain of Frozen Echoes](../Places/Geographical-Features/Mountain-of-Frozen-Echoes.md). 

They are ruled by [Jarl Yensiir Rimeblood](../NPCs/Monsters/Invidivuals/Jarl-Yensiir-Rimeblood.md).
