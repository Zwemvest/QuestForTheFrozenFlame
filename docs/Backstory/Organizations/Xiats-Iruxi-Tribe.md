# Xiat's Iruxi Tribe
This is [my](questforthefrozenflame/docs/Backstory/Party-Members/Xiat.md) [Iruxi](questforthefrozenflame/docs/Backstory/Notions/Races/Lizardfolk.md) tribe. I was born as a Wintertouched [Iruxi](questforthefrozenflame/docs/Backstory/Notions/Races/Lizardfolk.md), a rare [Iruxi](questforthefrozenflame/docs/Backstory/Notions/Races/Lizardfolk.md) that has sort of a natural anti-freeze in their blood. However, since [Iruxi](questforthefrozenflame/docs/Backstory/Notions/Races/Lizardfolk.md) are usually warmth-dwellers, I've been sent to live in the [far north](questforthefrozenflame/docs/Backstory/Places/Realm-of-the-Mammoth-Lords.md), in a realm better suited for me.
