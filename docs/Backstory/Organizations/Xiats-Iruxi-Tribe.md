# Xiat's Iruxi Tribe
This is [[Xiat|my]] [[Lizardfolk|Iruxi]] tribe. I was born as a Wintertouched [[Lizardfolk|Iruxi]], a rare [[Lizardfolk|Iruxi]] that has sort of a natural anti-freeze in their blood. However, since [[Lizardfolk|Iruxi]] are usually warmth-dwellers, I've been sent to live in the [[Realm-of-the-Mammoth-Lords|far north]], in a realm better suited for me.
