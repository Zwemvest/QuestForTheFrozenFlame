# Xiat's Iruxi Tribe
This is [[Xiat|my]] [[Lizardfolk|Iruxi]] tribe. I was born as a Wintertouched Iruxi, a rare Iruxi that has sort of a natural anti-freeze in their blood. However, since Iruxi are usually warmth-dwellers, I've been sent to live in the [[Realm-of-the-Mammoth-Lords|far north]], in a realm better suited for me.
