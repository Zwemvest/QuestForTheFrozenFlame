*Xiat's Note: Kaska is our big and strong orc-lady, carrying around two Orc Necksplitters and travelling with a Direwolf. Has been friends with [[Willow]] for as long as I know, or they know. Every friends group needs a Kaska, so people know not to play around with your group. Always willing to defend her friends. I respect her because she's also an animal lover.*
