Po La the Bureaucrat runs the town of [[Icestair]] in the [Realm of the Mammoth Lords](Realm-of-the-Mammoth-Lords) with the help of his assistants. His primary duty is the maintenance of the staircase that climbs the glacial war that connects [[Avistan]] with the [Crown of the World](Crown-of-the-World). Secondary duties include the repair of the massive winch used to haul freight and vehicles up and down the cliff face, as well as arranging for guides to help protect merchants as they journey south.

Since the opening of the [[Worldwound]] to the east there are no more absolutely safe routes to the richer nations of central [[Avistan]]. He is, therefore, in constant negotiation with the [[orc]]s of the [Hold of Belkzen](Hold-of-Belkzen) in order to arrange for safe passage through their territories.
