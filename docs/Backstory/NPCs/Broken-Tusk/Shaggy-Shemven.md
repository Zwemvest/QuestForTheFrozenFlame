Many weeks ago, Shemven caught sight of a “beautiful [[Lost-Raven-Woman|raven-woman]]” and fell hopelessly in love with her despite not even catching her name. He immediately set about looking for some way to woo this [[Lost-Raven-Woman|mysterious woman]]. A few days ago, he decided to pay a visit to this [[Rock-Loom|ancient stone circle]]—a site long known to [[korred]]s and many other fey of the [[Gornok-Plain|Gornok Plain]]—for guidance. Here, Shemven saw the stone carved in the likeness of a giant [[Rock-loom#Raven statue|Raven]] and took it as a sign. He used his magical powers to break off the top of the massive rock, then carried it up the forested hill to the north. His labor of love was expedited thanks to his ability to [[stone-stride|stride through stones]], which explains the strange gap in the tracks leading away from [[Rock-loom]]. Shemven planned to wait for his beloved at the top of this hill, but she’s nowhere to be found. In fact, if anything, the broken bird statue has only confused and angered the resident [[swarm-of-ravens|ravens]], who chase Shemven back to the hilltop whenever he tries to return the [[Rock-loom#Raven statue|Raven Stone]]. So, the [[korred]] lingers here, heartbroken and unable to devise a way of making things right.

We met Shaggy on [[Session-2#28 Calistril 4072|28 Calistril 4072]], and we offered to help him find the [[Lost-Raven-Woman]]. We also told him about the [[Broken-Tusk|Broken Tusk]], and he got very enthousiastic about our [[Mammoth]]s. We decided to allow him to join us, and the [[Broken-Tusk|Broken Tusk]] [[Following]].
