The great-grandson of [Eiwa’s](Grandfather-Eiwa) late sister and heir apparent of [Falcon House](Falcon-House).  Though the web of friendships in the [Broken Tusk](Broken-Tusk) [following](following) is complex, haughty and self-righteous Pakano is more likely to be your character’s rival or bully than a childhood chum.

*[Xiat](Xiat)'s note: Not a nice kid. Maybe the only person in the tribe that made me feel unwelcome. Constantly boasts about his own skills but couldn't pour milk out of a boot if you wrote the instructions on the sole. My only solace is that [Willow](Willow) and [Kaska](Kaska) also don't seem to be very fond of him.*
