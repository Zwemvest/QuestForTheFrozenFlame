# Mammoth
[Mammoth](https://pathfinderwiki.com/wiki/Elephant#Mammoths)s are a type of elephant that have long hair and larger tusks, and live in cold environments. They are more aggressive than common elephants due to living alongside more dangerous predators. 

Mammoths are domesticated and used as beasts of burden by many cultures, including our tribe, the [[Broken-Tusk]]. However, their high intelligence means that they must be handled with great care. Mammoths are also valued as impressive mounts by orcs from the [[Hold-of-Belkzen]].

Mammoths are also hunted for the ivory of their tusks, which can sell for very high prices. Certain groups perceive elephants as majestic creatures and seek to protect them, creating danger for elephant hunters.

[[Mammoth-Lord]]s sometimes take a mammoth as their mount.

[[Imek]] thought us a lot about our tribe's Mammoths. Sometimes we use [[Tapir]]s as early warning canaries for the dangers that mammoths may face.
