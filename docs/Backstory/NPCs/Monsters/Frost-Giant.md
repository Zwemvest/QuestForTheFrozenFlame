See also: [Giant.md](Giant)

[Frost giants](https://pathfinderwiki.com/wiki/Frost_giant) are a generally evil race of massive humanoids with white or blue-tinged skin, and stand close to 15 feet in height, weighing roughly 2,800 pounds. As they are impervious to cold, they tend to frequent [../../Places/Avistan.md](Avistan)'s northern latitudes. They are particularly common in the witch realm of [../../Places/Irrisen.md](Irrisen) and near the [Crown of the World](../../Places/Crown-of-the-World.md).
