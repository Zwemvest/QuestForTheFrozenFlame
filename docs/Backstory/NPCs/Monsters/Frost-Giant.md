[Frost giants](https://pathfinderwiki.com/wiki/Frost_giant) are a generally evil race of massive humanoids with white or blue-tinged skin, and stand close to 15 feet in height, weighing roughly 2,800 pounds. As they are impervious to cold, they tend to frequent [../../Places/Avistan.md](questforthefrozenflame/docs/Backstory/Places/Avistan.md)'s northern latitudes. They are particularly common in the witch realm of [../../Places/Irrisen.md](questforthefrozenflame/docs/Backstory/Places/Irrisen.md) and near the [Crown of the World](questforthefrozenflame/docs/Backstory/Places/Crown-of-the-World.md).
