# Tapir
![[tapir.png]]
With a blunt, prehensile trunk and a squat posture, tapirs resemble boars, though they're actually more closely related to horses and rhinoceroses. Tapirs live in loose herds that graze near rivers and lakes. They enjoy fresh water, not only for the lush plants that grow along the shores—which they eat in prodigious quantities— but also for the protection the water provides. When predators approach, tapirs retreat to the water to hide, keeping their snouts barely above the surface to breathe. Likewise, the breezes and scents that accompany creeks and rivers mask tapirs' musk as they travel along these waterways. Despite their ungainly movement, tapirs are remarkably sure-footed, easily traversing mud and similar terrain thanks to their broad toes.

[[Imek]] thaught us that the [[Broken-Tusk]] uses tapirs as early warning canaries for their [[Mammoth]] herd.
