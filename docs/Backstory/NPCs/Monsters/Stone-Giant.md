# Stone Giant
See also: [[Giant]]

[Stone giants](https://pathfinderwiki.com/wiki/Stone_giant) are large humanoids with dark gray, leathery skin, who grow to about 12 feet in height. They tend to be both impassive and aloof, preferring to live in solitude in hills, caves, and mountains. Because of their skin color they tend to blend in among their stony surroundingsâ€”all the easier from them to crush unwary travelers with giant thrown boulders.
