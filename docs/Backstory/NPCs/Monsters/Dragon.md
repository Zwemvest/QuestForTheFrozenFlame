![Dragon.png](Dragon.png)
[Dragon](https://pathfinderwiki.com/wiki/Dragon)s are an ancient race of intelligent reptilian creatures who often possess a variety of magical and unusual abilities, including winged or magical flight. Due to their power, they are counted among the most legendary creatures in all the [Avistan](Avistan) region. They are sometimes referred to as wyrms and wyrmlings.

Dragons are scaled, reptilian creatures with large wings capable of flight. A dragon has a long tail that can be used as a weapon, and typically has multiple horns on its head and a ridge or horns along its spine. The differing types of dragons are named according to their color; for instance, green dragons are green-scaled. _(See also "[Draconic septs](https://pathfinderwiki.com/wiki/Dragon#Draconic_septs)".)_ While size depends on the dragon's type, very young dragons are about the size of an adult humanoid, whereas adult dragons rival the largest [giant](giant)s in size, and the oldest dragons can tower over buildings.
