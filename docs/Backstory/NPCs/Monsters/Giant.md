# Giant
![giant.png](questforthefrozenflame/docs/Images/Monsters/giant.png)

[Giant](https://pathfinderwiki.com/wiki/Giant) is the name given to a large number of over-sized humanoids living on [Golarion](questforthefrozenflame/docs/Backstory/Places/Golarion.md).

All giants share one common trait: massive humanoid forms. They often range from 12 to 40 feet tall and measure their weight in tons.

The [Kellid](questforthefrozenflame/docs/Backstory/Notions/Kellid.md)s of the [Realm of the Mammoth Lords](questforthefrozenflame/docs/Backstory/Places/Realm-of-the-Mammoth-Lords.md) have a somewhat contradictory relationship with giants. They war against giant tribes almost constantly, but are known to take in captured giant children and raise them as their own. Having a giant in one's tribe is a sign of power among the [Mammoth Lord](questforthefrozenflame/docs/Backstory/Notions/Mammoth-Lord.md)s [following](questforthefrozenflame/docs/Backstory/Notions/Following.md)s, and the children are raised as honored members. Some mystics regard these giants with near religious fervor, and in time many giants learn to identify with the tribe and fight to protect them.

## Varieties:
[Frost Giant](questforthefrozenflame/docs/Backstory/NPCs/Monsters/Frost-Giant.md)
> White or blue-tinged giants that are impervious to cold, and tend to frequent [Avistan](questforthefrozenflame/docs/Backstory/Places/Avistan.md)'s northern latitudes.

[Storm Giant](questforthefrozenflame/docs/Backstory/NPCs/Monsters/Storm-Giant.md)
>Amongst the most powerful of giant kind, these gaints are mercurial and fierce like the storms after which they are named.

[Stone Giant](questforthefrozenflame/docs/Backstory/NPCs/Monsters/Stone-Giant.md)
>Large humanoids with dark gray, leathery skin, preferring to live in solitude in hills, caves, and mountains. Because of their skin color they tend to blend in among their stony surroundings.
