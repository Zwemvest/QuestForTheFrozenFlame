# Giant
![[giant.png]]

[Giant](https://pathfinderwiki.com/wiki/Giant) is the name given to a large number of over-sized humanoids living on [[Golarion]].

All giants share one common trait: massive humanoid forms. They often range from 12 to 40 feet tall and measure their weight in tons.

## Frost Giant
[Frost giants](https://pathfinderwiki.com/wiki/Frost_giant) are a generally evil race of massive humanoids with white or blue-tinged skin, and stand close to 15 feet in height, weighing roughly 2,800 pounds. As they are impervious to cold, they tend to frequent [[Avistan]]'s northern latitudes. They are particularly common in the witch realm of [[Irrisen]] and near the [[Crown-of-the-World]].

## Storm Giant
Amongst the most powerful of giant kind, [storm giants](https://pathfinderwiki.com/wiki/Storm_giant) often tower over 20 feet in height. They are essentially good in nature, but are mercurial and fierce like the storms after which they are named.

## Stone Giant
[Stone giants](https://pathfinderwiki.com/wiki/Stone_giant) are large humanoids with dark gray, leathery skin, who grow to about 12 feet in height. They tend to be both impassive and aloof, preferring to live in solitude in hills, caves, and mountains. Because of their skin color they tend to blend in among their stony surroundingsâ€”all the easier from them to crush unwary travelers with giant thrown boulders.
