[White dragon](https://pathfinderwiki.com/wiki/White_dragon)s tend to be the most feral and animalistic of the chromatic dragons, relying on sheer force rather than elaborate plans or strategies. They live in cold mountain regions and arctic lowlands, making homes within freezing ice caves or other remote areas. Masters of the cold, white dragons employ freezing breath and a number of cold-based spells in order to freeze prey and foe alike. They prefer their food frozen solid.

White dragons are primarily distinguished by their snow-white scales, which are thick and patterned with tiny ridges. Their heads bear a number of horns radiating backwards from their crowns, which are connected by a tough membrane. Clusters of small horns grow over their faces and lower jaws, and a similar texture extends over their bodies, breaking up their silhouettes. White dragons are lithe and muscular.
