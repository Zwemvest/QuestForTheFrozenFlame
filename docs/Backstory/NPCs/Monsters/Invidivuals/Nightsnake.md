# Nightsnake
The [Nightsnake](https://pathfinderwiki.com/wiki/Nightsnake) is a mythical, flying predator that stalks the [[Kellid]] people of the [Ginji Mesa](Ginji-Mesa) in the [Realm of the Mammoth Lords](Realm-of-the-Mammoth-Lords). Said to have bat-like wings and a serpent's body, it can transfix its prey with a single stare. Whatever the truth may be, the Nightsnake is blamed for the disappearance of countless people and livestock.
