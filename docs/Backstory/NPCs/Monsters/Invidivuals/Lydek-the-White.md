# Lydek the White
The adult [White Dragon](questforthefrozenflame/docs/Backstory/NPCs/Monsters/White-Dragon.md) [Lydek](https://pathfinderwiki.com/wiki/White_dragon) makes her home near [Mount Thaharak](questforthefrozenflame/docs/Backstory/Places/Geographical-Features/Mount-Thaharak.md) in the [Tusk Mountains](questforthefrozenflame/docs/Backstory/Places/Geographical-Features/Tusk-Mountains.md) on the edge of the [Realm of the Mammoth Lords](questforthefrozenflame/docs/Backstory/Places/Realm-of-the-Mammoth-Lords.md). She is known for her savagery, especially against [human](questforthefrozenflame/docs/Backstory/Notions/Races/Human.md)s, sometimes attacking them for the simple pleasure of feeling the life draining from their bodies. A number of trade routes have been rerouted due to her attacks, although due to the remoteness of her territory, this has not drawn the attention of dedicated dragon slayers. Those who do make the trek to her lair find the mountain covered in numerous pitfalls, traps, and prone to avalanches. Lydek uses these to her advantage in order to weaken challengers before facing them in person.

The [Icerender tribe](questforthefrozenflame/docs/Backstory/Organizations/Icerender-tribe.md) of kobolds regularly pay tribute to Lydek the White bringing her treasure they have captured from ill-fated caravans; ironically, these caravans are often taking routes away from Lydek's hunting zones.
