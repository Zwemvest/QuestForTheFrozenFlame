# Jarl Gnargorak
[Jarl Gnargorak](https://pathfinderwiki.com/wiki/Gnargorak), the self-proclaimed king of all [Frost Giant](questforthefrozenflame/docs/Backstory/NPCs/Monsters/Giant.md#Frost%20Giant), rules from [Bos-Phargrumm](questforthefrozenflame/docs/Backstory/Places/Places-of-Interest/Bos-Phargrumm.md), an ice castle perched high among the peaks of the [Tusk Mountains](questforthefrozenflame/docs/Backstory/Places/Geographical-Features/Tusk-Mountains.md) northwest of the [Ginji Mesa](questforthefrozenflame/docs/Backstory/Places/Geographical-Features/Ginji-Mesa.md). It is said that he took the title after he slew a silver [dragon](questforthefrozenflame/docs/Backstory/NPCs/Monsters/Dragon.md) alone and then mounted the dragon's horns on his staff and used its hide for the grip of his legendary sword's hilt. A harem of cloud giants serve as his personal guard and advisors when he stays in [Bos-Phargrumm](questforthefrozenflame/docs/Backstory/Places/Places-of-Interest/Bos-Phargrumm.md). Jarl Gnargorak commands legions of [Frost Giant](questforthefrozenflame/docs/Backstory/NPCs/Monsters/Giant.md#Frost%20Giant) warriors and he leads incursions against the [Kellid](questforthefrozenflame/docs/Backstory/Notions/Kellid.md) tribes of the [Realm of the Mammoth Lords](questforthefrozenflame/docs/Backstory/Places/Realm-of-the-Mammoth-Lords.md). His forces are also enemies of the [Icerender tribe](questforthefrozenflame/docs/Backstory/Organizations/Icerender-tribe.md) of white-scaled kobolds resident in the [Tusk Mountains](questforthefrozenflame/docs/Backstory/Places/Geographical-Features/Tusk-Mountains.md).
