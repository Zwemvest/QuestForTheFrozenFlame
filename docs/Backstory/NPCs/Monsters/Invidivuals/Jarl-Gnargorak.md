# Jarl Gnargorak
[Jarl Gnargorak](https://pathfinderwiki.com/wiki/Gnargorak), the self-proclaimed king of all [frost giants](Giant#Frost Giant), rules from [Bos-Phargrumm](Bos-Phargrumm), an ice castle perched high among the peaks of the [Tusk Mountains](Tusk-Mountains) northwest of the [Ginji Mesa](Ginji-Mesa). It is said that he took the title after he slew a silver [dragon](dragon) alone and then mounted the dragon's horns on his staff and used its hide for the grip of his legendary sword's hilt. A harem of cloud giants serve as his personal guard and advisors when he stays in [Bos-Phargrumm](Bos-Phargrumm). Jarl Gnargorak commands legions of [frost giant](Giant#Frost Giant) warriors and he leads incursions against the [Kellid](Kellid) tribes of the [Realm of the Mammoth Lords](Realm-of-the-Mammoth-Lords). His forces are also enemies of the [Icerender tribe](Icerender-tribe) of white-scaled kobolds resident in the [Tusk Mountains](Tusk-Mountains).
