# Jarl Gnargorak
[Jarl Gnargorak](https://pathfinderwiki.com/wiki/Gnargorak), the self-proclaimed king of all [[Giant#Frost Giant|frost giants]], rules from [[Bos-Phargrumm]], an ice castle perched high among the peaks of the [[Tusk-Mountains]] northwest of the [[Ginji-Mesa]]. It is said that he took the title after he slew a silver [[dragon]] alone and then mounted the dragon's horns on his staff and used its hide for the grip of his legendary sword's hilt. A harem of cloud giants serve as his personal guard and advisors when he stays in [[Bos-Phargrumm]]. Jarl Gnargorak commands legions of [[Giant#Frost Giant|frost giant]] warriors and he leads incursions against the [[Kellid]] tribes of the [[Realm-of-the-Mammoth-Lords]]. His forces are also enemies of the [[Icerender-tribe]] of white-scaled kobolds resident in the [[Tusk-Mountains]].
