See also: [[Dragon]]

[Green dragons](https://pathfinderwiki.com/wiki/Green_dragon) breathe acid-breath, live in temperate forests, and have a connection with both nature and the forest. Known to speak Elven and Sylvan, green dragons can often be swayed by diplomacy, anathema to many of their fellow chromatic dragons

Green dragons have the most immediately recognisable heads of any dragon due to the large snout horn that dominates their face; these horns continue to grow throughout the dragon's life. Their horns can grow so large that they actually create a blind-spot in the dragon's vision and each dragon's horn is unique in its shape. Green dragons require personal perfection in every aspect of themselves, including their body; they often undertake strenuous exercise regimes to keep in peak physical condition.
