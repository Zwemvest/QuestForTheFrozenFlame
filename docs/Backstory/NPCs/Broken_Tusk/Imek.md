The knowledgeable young herder Imek will help further the charactersâ€™ training as scouts. As native Broken Tusks, she can also teach the characters much about the history, customs, and values of the [[Broken_Tusk]] [[Following]].

*Xiat's Note: She can infodump about the Broken Tusks Mammoths for days straight if you let her. I let her, it was great.*
