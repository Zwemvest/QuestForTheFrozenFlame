# Desna
**[Desna](https://pathfinderwiki.com/wiki/Desna)** (pronounced DEZ-nuh) was one of the first [deities](https://pathfinderwiki.com/wiki/Deity "Deity"), but while her peers burdened themselves with the task of creating [Golarion](Golarion), she spent her time building the heavens. She knew that there would be plenty of time for her and her followers to explore the many wonders of the world later. She's changed little since those earlier days, and she and her followers delight in exploring the world.

Desna is the patron deity of [Xiat](Xiat), but if Desna actually answers to [Xiat](Xiat) or if it's all just a bit wishful thinking remains to be seen. 

*[Xiat](Xiat)'s note: this is Desna! She guides the stars! Every night I talk to the stars and hope she replies. She never does, but I know I'm her favored and destined to become a new Lizard King, so surely she someday will!*
