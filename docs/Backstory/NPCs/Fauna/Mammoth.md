# Mammoth

See also: [[Elephant]]

[Mammoths](https://pathfinderwiki.com/wiki/Elephant#Mammoths)s are a type of [[elephant]] that have long hair and larger tusks, and live in cold environments. They are more aggressive than common elephants due to living alongside more dangerous predators. 

Mammoths are domesticated and used as beasts of burden by many cultures, including our tribe, the [Broken Tusk](Broken-Tusk). However, their high intelligence means that they must be handled with great care. Mammoths are also valued as impressive mounts by [[orc]]s from the [Hold of Belkzen](Hold-of-Belkzen).

Mammoths are also hunted for the ivory of their tusks, which can sell for very high prices. Certain groups perceive elephants as majestic creatures and seek to protect them, creating danger for elephant hunters.

## Notes
[Mammoth Lord](Mammoth-Lord)s sometimes take a mammoth as their mount.

[[Imek]] thought us a lot about our [tribe](Broken-Tusk)'s Mammoths. Sometimes we use [[tapir]]s as early warning canaries for the dangers that mammoths may face. 

## Description
The [woolly mammoth](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/animals/elephant/elephant-mammoth/) is a relative of both the common [[elephant]] and the [[mastodon]]. Like the [[mastodon]], it is an herbivore and spends its days eating nuts, fruits, berries, and grasses. The typical mammoth consumes nearly 450 pounds of food and 50 gallons of water in a given day.

Mammoths travel in herds with the young moving in the center, protected and surrounded by the adults. If danger is present or a threat is imminent, the males move to face the danger, while the females encircle the young.

The woolly mammoth generally reproduces in the spring months with young being born about 22 months later. A young woolly mammoth resembles a miniature version of an adult, complete with fur, and under fur. It does not yet have the mighty tusks of the mammoth, though the tusks grow in quickly as the young mammoth reaches maturity (around age 12).

The mammoth has the same predators as the [[mastodon]], among others, the [[smilodon]]. Man hunts these creatures for the same reason they hunt the mastodon: meat, fur, ivory, or to capture young mammoths to be trained as mounts and beasts of burden.

The mammoth is a relative of the [[elephant]] and the [[mastodon]] though its head is slightly taller than an [[elephant]]’s and slightly wider than a [[mastodon]]’s. Its upward curving tusks are longer than those of the mastodon, and its trunk ends in two, small finger-like projections used for grasping branches, fruits, and other such small items. The mammoth stands about 22 feet tall and is covered in a thick coat of gray, brown, reddish-brown, yellowish-brown, or black fur with a coarse “under-fur” beneath it to protect it in harsh climates. Mammoths generally avoid combat unless provoked or the herd is threatened. They have no natural fear of any creature, so do not flee. If the herd is threatened, mammoths fight by goring with their tusks or trampling. Mammoths fight to the death to protect their young.
