# Auroch
[Aurochs](https://pathfinderwiki.com/wiki/Aurochs) are large migrating herd mammals, standing over 7 feet tall at the shoulder, which are closely related to domesticated cattle. They resemble large, razor-horned bison.

This large, horned bull has a dirty black hide and an aggressive temper. Its horns are wide and sharp.

Aurochs travel in herds, following the grass that quickly crops up in these volatile climates. They travel in this way to protect each other, adult males forming a ring around those less able to defend themselves when threats arise. Aurochs are most often used by people as a source of meat, wool, and leather.
