# Mastodon
See also: [[Elephant]]

This creature is larger than a normal elephant, with enormous sweeping tusks and shaggy brown fur on its body.

The [mastodon](https://pathfinderwiki.com/wiki/Elephant) is an ancient form of elephant that can still be occasionally encountered on [[Golarion]]. They have truly massive tusks that curve up towards one another, much larger than those of the elephant. They are distinguished from mammoths by their smaller size. They chiefly inhabit temperate forests, where they live in closely knit groups.

The great [mastodons](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/animals/elephant/elephant-mastodon/) are primeval cousins of elephants. Their large tusks [[dwarf]] those of regular [[elephant]]s, jutting outward and then curving back toward one another at the tips. [[Shaggy-Shemven|Shaggy]] woolly [[mammoth]]s are a mastodon cousin adapted to cold environments.
