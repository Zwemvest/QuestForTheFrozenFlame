# Elephant
These thick-skinned animals bear large ivory tusks flanking a long, prehensile snout.

These large land animals, majestically wandering the plains in tightly knit family herds, are symbols of wisdom and strength. Having few natural predators, elephants are sometimes hunted for their ivory tusks. These tusks often become jewelry, statuettes, and trinkets for the wealthy.

## Varieties:
[[Mammoth]]
>This massive elephant-like creature is covered in long, coarse hair, and its tusks sweep upward in great curves of yellowed ivory.

[[Mastodon]]
> This creature is larger than a normal elephant, with enormous sweeping tusks and shaggy brown fur on its body.
