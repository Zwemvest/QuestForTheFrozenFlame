# Elephant
These thick-skinned animals bear large ivory tusks flanking a long, prehensile snout.

These large land animals, majestically wandering the plains in tightly knit family herds, are symbols of wisdom and strength. Having few natural predators, elephants are sometimes hunted for their ivory tusks. These tusks often become jewelry, statuettes, and trinkets for the wealthy.
