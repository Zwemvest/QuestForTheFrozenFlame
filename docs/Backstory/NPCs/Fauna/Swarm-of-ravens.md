# Swarm of Ravens
_[Xiat](questforthefrozenflame/docs/Backstory/NPCs/People/Broken-Tusk/Party-Members/Xiat.md)'s note: The pitch-black birds that make up this torrent of claws and feathers glare ominously from hundreds of beady eyes._

A flock of ravens is known as an unkindness. Certainly the name lives up to its meaning when a swarm of ravens decides to work together. In most cases, a raven swarm won't attack larger foes, but when manipulated by supernatural forces or simple desperation born from hunger, an unkindness of ravens can be a surprisingly dangerous foe.

Angry raven swarms may target their opponentsâ€™ vulnerable faces.

## Notes
We were attacked by a swarm of ravens on [28 Calistril 4722](questforthefrozenflame/docs/Playing-Notes/Session-2.md#28%20Calistril%204722). They tried to peck my eyes out!
