# Armored Glyptodon
![Glyptodon.png](Glyptodon.png)
The glyptodon is an ill-tempered tortoise-like mammal protected by armoured osteoderms in turn composed of smaller scales. It has short limbs, a blunt head, a short spiky tail, and wicked claws.

The glyptodon is often hunted for the value of its outer armor, made up of bony plates in turn composed of many smaller, knobby “scales.” The creature is quite capable of defending itself with swipes from its deadly claws, as its ill-tempered nature often urges it to do.
