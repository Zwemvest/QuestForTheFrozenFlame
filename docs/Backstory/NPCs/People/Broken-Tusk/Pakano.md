The great-grandson of [Eiwa’s](questforthefrozenflame/docs/Backstory/NPCs/People/Broken-Tusk/Grandfather-Eiwa.md) late sister and heir apparent of [Falcon House](questforthefrozenflame/docs/Backstory/Organizations/Falcon-House.md).  Though the web of friendships in the [Broken Tusk](questforthefrozenflame/docs/Backstory/Organizations/Broken-Tusk.md) [following](questforthefrozenflame/docs/Backstory/Notions/Following.md) is complex, haughty and self-righteous Pakano is more likely to be your character’s rival or bully than a childhood chum.

*[Xiat](questforthefrozenflame/docs/Backstory/NPCs/People/Broken-Tusk/Party-Members/Xiat.md)'s note: Not a nice kid. Maybe the only person in the tribe that made me feel unwelcome. Constantly boasts about his own skills but couldn't pour milk out of a boot if you wrote the instructions on the sole. My only solace is that [Willow](questforthefrozenflame/docs/Backstory/NPCs/People/Broken-Tusk/Party-Members/Willow.md) and [Kaska](questforthefrozenflame/docs/Backstory/NPCs/People/Broken-Tusk/Party-Members/Kaska.md) also don't seem to be very fond of him.*
