*[Xiat](questforthefrozenflame/docs/Backstory/NPCs/People/Broken-Tusk/Party-Members/Xiat.md)'s Note: Willow is a sweet person, but do not view her sweetness as a weakness. She can easily be the fiercest member of our group if you do wrong by her. Has been friends with [Kaska](questforthefrozenflame/docs/Backstory/NPCs/People/Broken-Tusk/Party-Members/Kaska.md) for as long as I know, or they know. Always seems to be willing to try diplomacy, even to a fault (like the time we were met sword in hand). I respect her because she's also big on the occult stuff.*
