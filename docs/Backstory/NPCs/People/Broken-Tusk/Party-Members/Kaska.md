*[Xiat](questforthefrozenflame/docs/Backstory/NPCs/People/Broken-Tusk/Party-Members/Xiat.md)'s Note: Kaska is our big and strong [orc](questforthefrozenflame/docs/Backstory/Notions/Races/Orc.md)-lady, carrying around two [orc](questforthefrozenflame/docs/Backstory/Notions/Races/Orc.md) Necksplitters and travelling with a Direwolf. Has been friends with [Willow](questforthefrozenflame/docs/Backstory/NPCs/People/Broken-Tusk/Party-Members/Willow.md) for as long as I know, or they know. Every friends group needs a Kaska, so people know not to play around with your group. Always willing to defend her friends. I respect her because she's also an animal lover.*
