*[Xiat](questforthefrozenflame/docs/Backstory/Party-Members/Xiat.md)'s Note: Teeththief is our annoying, yet useful [goblin](questforthefrozenflame/docs/Backstory/Notions/Races/Goblin.md) companion. She's somewhat of the quiet type, which is surprising, since most goblins love to bellow the most filthy and disgusting sailor songs they can think off at any given moment. Mostly seems interested in my teeth, somehow. I respect her because she keeps our lives exciting.
