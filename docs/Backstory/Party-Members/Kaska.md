*[Xiat](Xiat)'s Note: Kaska is our big and strong [orc](orc)-lady, carrying around two [orc](orc) Necksplitters and travelling with a Direwolf. Has been friends with [Willow](Willow) for as long as I know, or they know. Every friends group needs a Kaska, so people know not to play around with your group. Always willing to defend her friends. I respect her because she's also an animal lover.*
