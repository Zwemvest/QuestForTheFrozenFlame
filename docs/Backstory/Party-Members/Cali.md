*[Xiat](questforthefrozenflame/docs/Backstory/Party-Members/Xiat.md)'s Note: One of our tribe's members. Was supposed to join us on our scout training but never did. Don't know if they left the tribe, or something else happened. I respect Cali because Cali is a person in the same boat as me: a similair fighting style, and trying to get powerful enough to prove himself.* 

I haven't seen Cali since [25 Calistril 4722](questforthefrozenflame/docs/Playing-Notes/Session-1.md#25%20Calistril%204722). We don't know what happened to him, did he leave the [Broken Tusk](questforthefrozenflame/docs/Backstory/Organizations/Broken-Tusk.md)? Our fellow tribespeople are weirdly silent.
