*[[Xiat]]'s Note: One of our tribe's members. Was supposed to join us on our scout training but never did. Don't know if they left the tribe, or something else happened. I respect Cali because Cali is a person in the same boat as me: a similair fighting style, and trying to get powerful enough to prove himself.* 

I haven't seen Cali since [[Session-1#25 Calistril 4072|25 Calistril 4072]]. We don't know what happened to him, did he leave the [[Broken-Tusk|Broken Tusk]]? Our fellow tribespeople are weirdly silent.
