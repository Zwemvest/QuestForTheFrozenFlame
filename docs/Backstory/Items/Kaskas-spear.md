# Kaska's spear
We found this spear on [27 Calistril 4072](Session-2#27 Calistril 4072). It is in the possession of [[Kaska]]. <font style="color:orangered"> It is a +1 spear, that adds a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls.</font> 

A tattered deer hide banner is tangled around the shaft near the spearhead; the banner is emblazoned with the black silhouette of a woolly mammoth against a backdrop of red flames. A charred human hand hangs from a leather strap tied to the spearâ€™s shaft. Shattered wrist bones tumble from the base of the severed appendage like pebbles from an open sack.

It bears the sigil of the [Burning Mammoth](Burning-Mammoth) tribe.
