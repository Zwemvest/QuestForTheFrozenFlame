# Primordial Flame
A legendary artifact, created by the [Kellid](questforthefrozenflame/docs/Backstory/Notions/Kellid.md) goddess [Sister Cinder](questforthefrozenflame/docs/Backstory/NPCs/Deities/Sister-Cinder.md) to lead her [believers](questforthefrozenflame/docs/Backstory/Organizations/Burning-Mammoth.md) out of the Age of Darkness. It is the source of our [former tribe](questforthefrozenflame/docs/Backstory/Organizations/Original-Burning-Mammoth.md)'s name, and considered the sacred birthright of our tribe.

During the [Fifth Mendevian Crusade](questforthefrozenflame/docs/Backstory/History/Fifth-Mendevian-Crusade.md), parts of our tribe split during [The Schism](questforthefrozenflame/docs/Backstory/History/The-Schism.md). The [Burning Mammoth](questforthefrozenflame/docs/Backstory/Organizations/Burning-Mammoth.md) went to fight [Demon](questforthefrozenflame/docs/Backstory/Notions/Demon.md)s in the east, and the remainder took the Primordial Flame and hid it. Since then, the rebels who took the flame call themselves the [Broken Tusk](questforthefrozenflame/docs/Backstory/Organizations/Broken-Tusk.md), our tribe.

[Grandfather Eiwa](questforthefrozenflame/docs/Backstory/NPCs/People/Broken-Tusk/Grandfather-Eiwa.md) explained this to us on the [28 Calistril 4722](questforthefrozenflame/docs/Playing-Notes/Session-2.md#Evening%20of%2028%20Calistril%204722)
