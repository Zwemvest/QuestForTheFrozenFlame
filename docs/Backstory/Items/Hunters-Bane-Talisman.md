# Hunter's Bane Talisman
We found this [talisman](https://2e.aonprd.com/Equipment.aspx?ID=217) on [27 Calistril 4722](questforthefrozenflame/docs/Playing-Notes/Session-2.md#27%2520Calistril%25204072). It is in the possession of [Xiat](questforthefrozenflame/docs/Backstory/Party-Members/Xiat.md)

This talisman is a ring of dried, interwoven leaves. <font style="color:orangered">When you activate the _hunter’s bane_, you sense the exact location of the attacker, making it hidden from you instead of undetected. If the attacker is behind lead, the hunter’s bane fails and is wasted.</font>
