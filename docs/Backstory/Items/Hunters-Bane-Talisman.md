# Hunter's Bane Talisman
We found this spear on [[Session-2#27 Calistril 4072|27 Calistril 4072]]. It is in the possession of [[Xiat]]

This talisman is a ring of dried, interwoven leaves. When you activate the _hunter’s bane_, you sense the exact location of the attacker, making it hidden from you instead of undetected. If the attacker is behind lead, the _hunter’s bane_ fails and is wasted.
