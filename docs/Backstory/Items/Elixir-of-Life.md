# Elixir of Life
[Elixirs of life](https://2e.aonprd.com/Equipment.aspx?ID=91) accelerate a living creature's natural healing processes and immune system. <font style="color:orangered"> Upon drinking this elixir, you regain the listed number of Hit Points and gain an item bonus to saving throws against diseases and poisons for 10 minutes. The elixir restores 1d6 Hit Points, and the bonus is +1.</font>

Elixirs are brewed by [Willow](questforthefrozenflame/docs/Backstory/Party-Members/Willow.md), at the beginning of each adventuring day, so each day we have one elixir available to us. It is a consumeable.
