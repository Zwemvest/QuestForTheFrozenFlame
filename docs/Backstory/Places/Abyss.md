# Abyss
The [Abyss](https://pathfinderwiki.com/wiki/Abyss) (pronounced uh-BIS) is a plane in the Outer Sphere dedicated to the rule of evil unfettered by law. Also referred to as the Outer Rifts, it is accessible through huge rents in the Maelstrom, opening into fiendish depths, vast beyond imagining. Sporadically, the demonic occupants of the Abyss will [pour](questforthefrozenflame/docs/Backstory/History/Fifth-Mendevian-Crusade.md) from these rents to menace [one plane or another](questforthefrozenflame/docs/Backstory/Places/Golarion.md), and sometimes even [tear](questforthefrozenflame/docs/Backstory/Places/Worldwound.md) their way into the Material Plane. The Abyss is possessed of many layers, strung together by the River Styx. Many of these planes are ruled by powerful and unique [demon](questforthefrozenflame/docs/Backstory/Notions/Demon.md) lords or, indeed, gods.
