![../../Images/Locations/Golarion_world_map.jpg](Golarion_world_map.jpg)
The planet [Golarion](https://pathfinderwiki.com/wiki/Golarion) orbits a yellow sun in the far reaches of the Material Plane. Third of eleven in orbit, this blue planet contains vast oceans and lush green lands, the perfect environment for countless cultures to thrive. Indeed, Golarion is the most populous planet in its solar system.

Golarion's crater-scarred moon, Somal, fills its night sky, and its nearest planetary neighbors, Castrovel the Green World and Akiton the Red Planet (second and fourth from the sun, respectively), are easily visible as colored stars.

The [Realm of the Mammoth Lords](Realm-of-the-Mammoth-Lords.md) can be found in [Avistan](Avistan.md), bordering the [Crown of the World](Crown-of-the-World.md) to the North.
