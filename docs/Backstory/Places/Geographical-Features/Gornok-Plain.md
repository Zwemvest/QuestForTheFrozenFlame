# Gornok Plain
The Gornok-Plain is a large plain in the [Realm of the Mammoth Lords](../Realm-of-the-Mammoth-Lords.md) somewhat to the west of the [Tusk Mountains](Tusk-Mountains.md). It is the location of the [Rock loom](../Places-of-Interest/Rock-loom.md) and the livingplace of [Shaggy Shemven](../../NPCs/Broken-Tusk/Shaggy-Shemven.md).

The [Broken Tusk](../../Organizations/Broken-Tusk.md) made camp here on [25 Calistril 4072](../../../Playing-Notes/Session-1.md#25%20Calistril%204072), so we could celebrate the [Green Moon Festival](../../History/Events/Green-Moon-Festival.md) on [1 Pharast 4072](../../../Playing-Notes/Session-3.md#1%20Pharast%204072). We caught a [Moose](../../NPCs/Fauna/Moose.md) here on [25 Calistril 4072](../../../Playing-Notes/Session-1.md#25%20Calistril%204072). 

We were ambushed here by the [Burning Mammoth](../../Organizations/Burning-Mammoth.md) on [26 Calistril 4072](../../../Playing-Notes/Session-1.md#26%20Calistril%204072). 

We found water and met [Kalbo](../../NPCs/Monsters/Invidivuals/Kalbo.md) on [27 Calistril 4072](../../../Playing-Notes/Session-2.md#27%20Calistril%204072)

We cleaned the [Rock loom](../Places-of-Interest/Rock-loom.md) on [28 Calistril 4072](../../../Playing-Notes/Session-2.md#28%20Calistril%204072). We also recruited [Shaggy Shemven](../../NPCs/Broken-Tusk/Shaggy-Shemven.md) into the [Broken Tusk](../../Organizations/Broken-Tusk.md).
