# Gornok Plain
The Gornok-Plain is a large plain in the [[Realm-of-the-Mammoth-Lords]] somewhat to the west of the [[Tusk-Mountains]]. It is the location of the [[Rock-loom]] and the livingplace of [[Shaggy-Shemven]].

The [[Broken-Tusk]] made camp here on [[Session-1#25 Calistril 4072|25 Calistril 4072]], so we could celebrate the [[Green-Moon-Festival]] on [[Session-3#1 Pharast 4072|1 Pharast 4072]]. We caught a [[Moose]] here on [[Session-1#25 Calistril 4072|25 Calistril 4072]]. 

We were ambushed here by the [[Burning-Mammoth]] on [[Session-1#26 Calistril 4072|26 Calistril 4072]]. 

We found water and met [[Kalbo]] on [[Session-1#27 Calistril 4072|27 Calistril 4072]]

We cleaned the [[Rock-loom]] on [[Session-1#28 Calistril 4072|28 Calistril 4072]]. We also recruited [[Shaggy-Shemven]] into the [[Broken-Tusk]].
