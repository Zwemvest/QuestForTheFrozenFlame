# The Frozen Road
The [Frozen Road](https://pathfinderwiki.com/wiki/Frozen_Road) is a frigid, slow-moving river that arises from the [[Tusk-Mountains]] in the [[Realm-of-the-Mammoth-Lords]] before continueing west through [[Irrisen]]. Floes of ice move westward downstream all year, often blocking river traffic for miles.
