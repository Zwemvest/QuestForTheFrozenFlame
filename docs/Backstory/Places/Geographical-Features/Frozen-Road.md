# The Frozen Road
The [Frozen Road](https://pathfinderwiki.com/wiki/Frozen_Road) is a frigid, slow-moving river that arises from the [[Tusk-Mountains]] in the [[Realm-of-the-Mammoth-Lords]] before continueing west through [[Irrisen]]. Floes of ice move westward downstream all year, often blocking river traffic for miles. A large number of ice cleaving teams out of the town of [Trezira](https://pathfinderwiki.com/wiki/Trezira "Trezira") patrol the river in 3-month tours along all its length breaking up the ice blocks. Frozen Road is populated by numerous fish, though more dangerous creatures live in or along the waterway, including many wild [feys](https://pathfinderwiki.com/wiki/Fey "Fey") .
