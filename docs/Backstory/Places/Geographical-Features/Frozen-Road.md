# The Frozen Road
The [Frozen Road](https://pathfinderwiki.com/wiki/Frozen_Road) is a frigid, slow-moving river that arises from the [Tusk Mountains](questforthefrozenflame/docs/Backstory/Places/Geographical-Features/Tusk-Mountains.md) in the [Realm of the Mammoth Lords](questforthefrozenflame/docs/Backstory/Places/Realm-of-the-Mammoth-Lords.md) before continueing west through [Irrisen](questforthefrozenflame/docs/Backstory/Places/Irrisen.md). Floes of ice move westward downstream all year, often blocking river traffic for miles.
