# Thunder Steppes
The [Thunder Steppes](https://pathfinderwiki.com/wiki/Thunder_Steppes) are a vast tundra on the eastern borders of the [Realm of the Mammoth Lords](Realm-of-the-Mammoth-Lords). They stretch all the way from the foothills of the [Tusk Mountains](Tusk-Mountains) in the west to the edge of the [[Worldwound]] in the east. The cold plains were once the domain of countless [[Kellid]] tribes who roamed the land, following the migrations of herd animals. Since the fall of Sarkoris and the opening of the [[Worldwound]], the land has become increasingly foul and dangerous, and now only herds of megafaua remain and grow increasingly hostile as the demonic taint takes hold of them.
