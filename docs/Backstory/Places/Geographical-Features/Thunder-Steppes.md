# Thunder Steppes
The [Thunder Steppes](https://pathfinderwiki.com/wiki/Thunder_Steppes) are a vast tundra on the eastern borders of the [Realm of the Mammoth Lords](questforthefrozenflame/docs/Backstory/Places/Realm-of-the-Mammoth-Lords.md). They stretch all the way from the foothills of the [Tusk Mountains](questforthefrozenflame/docs/Backstory/Places/Geographical-Features/Tusk-Mountains.md) in the west to the edge of the [Worldwound](questforthefrozenflame/docs/Backstory/Places/Worldwound.md) in the east. The cold plains were once the domain of countless [Kellid](questforthefrozenflame/docs/Backstory/Notions/Kellid.md) tribes who roamed the land, following the migrations of herd animals. Since the fall of Sarkoris and the opening of the [Worldwound](questforthefrozenflame/docs/Backstory/Places/Worldwound.md), the land has become increasingly foul and dangerous, and now only herds of megafaua remain and grow increasingly hostile as the demonic taint takes hold of them.
