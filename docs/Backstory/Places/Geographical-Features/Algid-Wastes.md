# Algid Wastes
The desolate badlands known as the [Algid Wastes](https://pathfinderwiki.com/wiki/Algid_Wastes) lie at the northern edge of the [[Hold-of-Belkzen]], where the land meets the [[Realm-of-the-Mammoth-Lords]]. The Wastes are even more desolate than the badlands to the south, being higher in elevation and covered nearly year-round by a blanket of snow. The [[orc]]s of [[Hold-of-Belkzen|Belkzen]] pass through this land in caravans on their way north to poach the megafauna that give the [[Realm-of-the-Mammoth-Lords]] its name. The [[orc]]s also fear the Wastes, as they are home to remorhaz, also known to the [[orc]]s as "ghost worms."
