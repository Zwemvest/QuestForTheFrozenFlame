# Algid Wastes
The desolate badlands known as the [Algid Wastes](https://pathfinderwiki.com/wiki/Algid_Wastes) lie at the northern edge of the [Hold of Belkzen](questforthefrozenflame/docs/Backstory/Places/Hold-of-Belkzen.md), where the land meets the [Realm of the Mammoth Lords](questforthefrozenflame/docs/Backstory/Places/Realm-of-the-Mammoth-Lords.md). The Wastes are even more desolate than the badlands to the south, being higher in elevation and covered nearly year-round by a blanket of snow. The [orc](questforthefrozenflame/docs/Backstory/Notions/Races/Orc.md)s of [Belkzen](questforthefrozenflame/docs/Backstory/Places/Hold-of-Belkzen.md) pass through this land in caravans on their way north to poach the megafauna that give the [Realm of the Mammoth Lords](questforthefrozenflame/docs/Backstory/Places/Realm-of-the-Mammoth-Lords.md) its name. The [orc](questforthefrozenflame/docs/Backstory/Notions/Races/Orc.md)s also fear the Wastes, as they are home to remorhaz, also known to the [orc](questforthefrozenflame/docs/Backstory/Notions/Races/Orc.md)s as "ghost worms."
