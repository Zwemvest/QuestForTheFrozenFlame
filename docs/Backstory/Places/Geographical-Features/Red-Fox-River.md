# Red Fox River
The [Red Fox River](https://pathfinderwiki.com/wiki/Red_Fox_River) is a tributary of the [Gullik River](Gullik-River) that flows through southeastern [Irrisen](Irrisen). It originates in the northern [Kodar Mountains](Kodar-Mountains). After flowing eastward for under 100 miles, it turns north and eventually flows into the [Gullik River](Gullik-River). For its entire length, the Red Fox forms the border between [Irrisen](Irrisen) and the [Realm of the Mammoth Lords](Realm-of-the-Mammoth-Lords).

Merchants use the Red Fox to transport goods from the [Realm of the Mammoth Lords](Realm-of-the-Mammoth-Lords) into [Irrisen](Irrisen).
