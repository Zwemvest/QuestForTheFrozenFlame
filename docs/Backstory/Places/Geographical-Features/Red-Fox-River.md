# Red Fox River
The [Red Fox River](https://pathfinderwiki.com/wiki/Red_Fox_River) is a tributary of the [Gullik River](questforthefrozenflame/docs/Backstory/Places/Geographical-Features/Gullik-River.md) that flows through southeastern [Irrisen](questforthefrozenflame/docs/Backstory/Places/Irrisen.md). It originates in the northern [Kodar Mountains](questforthefrozenflame/docs/Backstory/Places/Geographical-Features/Kodar-Mountains.md). After flowing eastward for under 100 miles, it turns north and eventually flows into the [Gullik River](questforthefrozenflame/docs/Backstory/Places/Geographical-Features/Gullik-River.md). For its entire length, the Red Fox forms the border between [Irrisen](questforthefrozenflame/docs/Backstory/Places/Irrisen.md) and the [Realm of the Mammoth Lords](questforthefrozenflame/docs/Backstory/Places/Realm-of-the-Mammoth-Lords.md).

Merchants use the Red Fox to transport goods from the [Realm of the Mammoth Lords](questforthefrozenflame/docs/Backstory/Places/Realm-of-the-Mammoth-Lords.md) into [Irrisen](questforthefrozenflame/docs/Backstory/Places/Irrisen.md).
