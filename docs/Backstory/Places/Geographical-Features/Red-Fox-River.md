# Red Fox River
The [Red Fox River](https://pathfinderwiki.com/wiki/Red_Fox_River) is a tributary of the [[Gullik-River]] that flows through southeastern [[Irrisen]]. It originates in the northern [[Kodar-Mountains]]. After flowing eastward for under 100 miles, it turns north and eventually flows into the [[Gullik-River]]. For its entire length, the Red Fox forms the border between [[Irrisen]] and the [[Realm-of-the-Mammoth-Lords]].

Merchants use the Red Fox to transport goods from the [[Realm-of-the-Mammoth-Lords]] into [[Irrisen]].
