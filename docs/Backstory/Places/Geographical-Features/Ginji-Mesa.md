# Ginji Mesa
The [Ginji Mesa](https://pathfinderwiki.com/wiki/Ginji_Mesa) is a large plain in the [Realm of the Mammoth Lords](../Realm-of-the-Mammoth-Lords.md) east of the southern [Tusk Mountains](Tusk-Mountains.md). To its north rise the northern [Tusk Mountains](Tusk-Mountains.md), while to its east are the dangerous [Thunder Steppes](Thunder-Steppes.md). The Ginji Mesa is not without its own dangers, however, as the tribes and [following](../../Notions/Following.md)s here fear the mythical [Nightsnake](../../NPCs/Monsters/Invidivuals/Nightsnake.md)
