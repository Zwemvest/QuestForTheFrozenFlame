# Gullik River
The [Gullik River](https://pathfinderwiki.com/wiki/Gullik_River) springs from a northern branch of the [Kodar Mountains](questforthefrozenflame/docs/Backstory/Places/Geographical-Features/Kodar-Mountains.md) and meanders northwest through the [Algid Wastes](questforthefrozenflame/docs/Backstory/Places/Geographical-Features/Algid-Wastes.md) for 100 miles before it is fed by its [Red Fox River](questforthefrozenflame/docs/Backstory/Places/Geographical-Features/Red-Fox-River.md) tributary. Less than 50 miles beyond that it is joined by the [Wayward River](questforthefrozenflame/docs/Backstory/Places/Geographical-Features/Wayward-River.md), which flows from the [Tusk Mountains](questforthefrozenflame/docs/Backstory/Places/Geographical-Features/Tusk-Mountains.md) to the east. Then it continues north for the last 150 miles of its course, acting as the border between [Irrisen](questforthefrozenflame/docs/Backstory/Places/Irrisen.md) and the [Realm of the Mammoth Lords](questforthefrozenflame/docs/Backstory/Places/Realm-of-the-Mammoth-Lords.md), before it flows into the [Frozen Road](questforthefrozenflame/docs/Backstory/Places/Geographical-Features/Frozen-Road.md) River. [Kellid](questforthefrozenflame/docs/Backstory/Notions/Kellid.md) tribes often clash with Irriseni raiders in this bloody, lonely area, while packs of trolls and ice trolls pick off members of both groups, and their long-dead ghosts haunt the battlefields.
