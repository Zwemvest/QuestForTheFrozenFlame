# Gullik River
The [Gullik River](https://pathfinderwiki.com/wiki/Gullik_River) springs from a northern branch of the [Kodar Mountains](Kodar-Mountains) and meanders northwest through the [Algid Wastes](Algid-Wastes) for 100 miles before it is fed by its [Red Fox River](Red-Fox-River) tributary. Less than 50 miles beyond that it is joined by the [Wayward River](Wayward-River), which flows from the [Tusk Mountains](Tusk-Mountains) to the east. Then it continues north for the last 150 miles of its course, acting as the border between [[Irrisen]] and the [Realm of the Mammoth Lords](Realm-of-the-Mammoth-Lords), before it flows into the [Frozen Road](Frozen-Road) River. [[Kellid]] tribes often clash with Irriseni raiders in this bloody, lonely area, while packs of trolls and ice trolls pick off members of both groups, and their long-dead ghosts haunt the battlefields.
