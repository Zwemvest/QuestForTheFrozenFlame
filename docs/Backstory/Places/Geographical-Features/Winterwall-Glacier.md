# Winterwall Glacier
The [Winterwall Glacier](https://pathfinderwiki.com/wiki/Winterwall_Glacier) is a truly massive sheet of ice stretching down from the [Crown of the World](../Crown-of-the-World.md) into far-northern [Avistan](../Avistan.md). A truly desolate and cold land, it is the home of [frost giants](Giant#Frost Giant), [white dragons](Dragon#White Dragon), and even more dangerous creatures.

Its edge dips southward into the frigid land of [Irrisen](../Irrisen.md), continuing in a generally easterly direction, until the [Tusk Mountains](Tusk-Mountains.md) in the [Realm of the Mammoth Lords](../Realm-of-the-Mammoth-Lords.md) form its eastern border.
