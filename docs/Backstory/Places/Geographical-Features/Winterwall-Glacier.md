# Winterwall Glacier
The [Winterwall Glacier](https://pathfinderwiki.com/wiki/Winterwall_Glacier) is a truly massive sheet of ice stretching down from the [Crown of the World](questforthefrozenflame/docs/Backstory/Places/Crown-of-the-World.md) into far-northern [Avistan](questforthefrozenflame/docs/Backstory/Places/Avistan.md). A truly desolate and cold land, it is the home of [Frost Giants](questforthefrozenflame/docs/Backstory/NPCs/Monsters/Frost-Giant.md), [White Dragons](questforthefrozenflame/docs/Backstory/NPCs/Monsters/White-Dragon.md), and even more dangerous creatures.

Its edge dips southward into the frigid land of [Irrisen](questforthefrozenflame/docs/Backstory/Places/Irrisen.md), continuing in a generally easterly direction, until the [Tusk Mountains](questforthefrozenflame/docs/Backstory/Places/Geographical-Features/Tusk-Mountains.md) in the [Realm of the Mammoth Lords](questforthefrozenflame/docs/Backstory/Places/Realm-of-the-Mammoth-Lords.md) form its eastern border.
