# Winterwall Glacier
The [Winterwall Glacier](https://pathfinderwiki.com/wiki/Winterwall_Glacier) is a truly massive sheet of ice stretching down from the [[Crown-of-the-World|Crown of the World]] into far-northern [[Avistan]]. A truly desolate and cold land, it is the home of [[Giant#Frost Giant|frost giants]], [[Dragon#White Dragon|white dragons]], and even more dangerous creatures.

Its edge dips southward into the frigid land of [[Irrisen]], continuing in a generally easterly direction, until the [[Tusk-Mountains|Tusk Mountains]] in the [[Realm-of-the-Mammoth-Lords|Realm of the Mammoth Lords]] form its eastern border.
