# Kodar Mountains
The [Kodar Mountains](https://pathfinderwiki.com/wiki/Kodar_Mountains), sometimes also known as the World's Roof, are among the highest mountain ranges in [Avistan](questforthefrozenflame/docs/Backstory/Places/Avistan.md). Located in the north of [Avistan](questforthefrozenflame/docs/Backstory/Places/Avistan.md), they form the natural boundary between several nations. The extensive range forms the southern border of the [Realm of the Mammoth Lords](questforthefrozenflame/docs/Backstory/Places/Realm-of-the-Mammoth-Lords.md) and [Irrisen](questforthefrozenflame/docs/Backstory/Places/Irrisen.md), partially separating it from the [Hold of Belkzen](questforthefrozenflame/docs/Backstory/Places/Hold-of-Belkzen.md). Few creatures call the Kodars their home, as only the toughest creatures can survive there.
