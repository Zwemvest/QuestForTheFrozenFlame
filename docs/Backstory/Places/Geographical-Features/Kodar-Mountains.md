# Kodar Mountains
The [Kodar Mountains](https://pathfinderwiki.com/wiki/Kodar_Mountains), sometimes also known as the World's Roof, are among the highest mountain ranges in [[Avistan]]. Located in the north of [[Avistan]], they form the natural boundary between several nations. The extensive range forms the southern border of the [[Realm-of-the-Mammoth-Lords]] and [[Irrisen]], partially separating it from the [Hold of Belkzen](https://pathfinderwiki.com/wiki/Hold_of_Belkzen "Hold of Belkzen") . Few creatures call the Kodars their home, as only the toughest creatures can survive there.
