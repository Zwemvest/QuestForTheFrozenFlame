# Kodar Mountains
The [Kodar Mountains](https://pathfinderwiki.com/wiki/Kodar_Mountains), sometimes also known as the World's Roof, are among the highest mountain ranges in [Avistan](Avistan). Located in the north of [Avistan](Avistan), they form the natural boundary between several nations. The extensive range forms the southern border of the [Realm of the Mammoth Lords](Realm-of-the-Mammoth-Lords) and [Irrisen](Irrisen), partially separating it from the [Hold of Belkzen](Hold-of-Belkzen). Few creatures call the Kodars their home, as only the toughest creatures can survive there.
