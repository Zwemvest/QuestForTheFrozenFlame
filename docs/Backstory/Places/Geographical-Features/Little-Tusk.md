The [Little Tusk](https://pathfinderwiki.com/wiki/Little_Tusk) is a tributary of the [Frozen Road](questforthefrozenflame/docs/Backstory/Places/Geographical-Features/Frozen-Road.md) river that begins in the northern [Tusk Mountains](questforthefrozenflame/docs/Backstory/Places/Geographical-Features/Tusk-Mountains.md) of the [Realm of the Mammoth Lords](questforthefrozenflame/docs/Backstory/Places/Realm-of-the-Mammoth-Lords.md). It flows southwestward for approximately 75 miles before joining the larger stream and from there flowing generally westward over the frigid plains and into [Irrisen](questforthefrozenflame/docs/Backstory/Places/Irrisen.md).
