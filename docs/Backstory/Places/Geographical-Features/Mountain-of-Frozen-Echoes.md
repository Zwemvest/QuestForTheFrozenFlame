# Mountain of Frozen Echoes
The [Mountain of Frozen Echoes](https://pathfinderwiki.com/wiki/Mountain_of_Frozen_Echoes) is located in the [Realm of the Mammoth Lords](questforthefrozenflame/docs/Backstory/Places/Realm-of-the-Mammoth-Lords.md)' [Tusk Mountains](questforthefrozenflame/docs/Backstory/Places/Geographical-Features/Tusk-Mountains.md). It is holy to the local [Kellid](questforthefrozenflame/docs/Backstory/Notions/Kellid.md) tribes, and contains an ancient shrine dedicated to their ancestors. It is also the home of the [Jhodagarn clan](questforthefrozenflame/docs/Backstory/Organizations/Jhodagarn-clan.md) clan of [Frost Giant](questforthefrozenflame/docs/Backstory/NPCs/Monsters/Giant.md#Frost%20Giant)s who slaughtered the local barbarians in the mid-47th century AR and took control of the mountain.
