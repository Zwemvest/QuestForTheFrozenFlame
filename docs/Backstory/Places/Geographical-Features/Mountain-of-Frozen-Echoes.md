# Mountain of Frozen Echoes
The [Mountain of Frozen Echoes](https://pathfinderwiki.com/wiki/Mountain_of_Frozen_Echoes) is located in the [[Realm-of-the-Mammoth-Lords]]' [[Tusk-Mountains]]. It is holy to the local [[Kellid]] tribes, and contains an ancient shrine dedicated to their ancestors. It is also the home of the [[Jhodagarn-clan]] clan of [[Giant#Frost Giant|Frost Giant]]s who slaughtered the local barbarians in the mid-47th century AR and took control of the mountain.
