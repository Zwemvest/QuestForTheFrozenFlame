# The Flood Road
The [Flood Road](https://pathfinderwiki.com/wiki/Flood_Road) is a highway of cracked mud for most of the year that runs roughly parallel to the [[Tusk-Mountains]]. It begins south of the town of [[Hillcross]] in the [[Realm-of-the-Mammoth-Lords]] and runs in a southerly direction past the [[Algid-Wastes]], towards the [[orc]]ish [[Hold-of-Belkzen]]

## Road or River?
The name Flood Road is a misleading title since it is only actually a road for 10 months of the year. For the other two months it is a muddy deluge fed by the spring melt from the [[Tusk-Mountains]], further to the north in the [[Realm-of-the-Mammoth-Lords]]. The flood road is nonetheless the lifeblood of the [[Hold-of-Belkzen|Hold of Belkzen]], as it the main trade route between Wyvernsting and Urgir. It also provides access to the [[Realm-of-the-Mammoth-Lords]], and many caravans head up the Flood Road in an attempt to capture the strange megafauna of that distant realm. When the Flood Road floods, the water from the [[Tusk-Mountains]] help rejuvenate the land, but can be dangerous to anyone traveling the road, as it travels in a devastating flash flood.
