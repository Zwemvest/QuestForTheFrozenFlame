# The Flood Road
The [Flood Road](https://pathfinderwiki.com/wiki/Flood_Road) is a highway of cracked mud for most of the year that runs roughly parallel to the [Tusk Mountains](Tusk-Mountains.md). It begins south of the town of [Hillcross](../Settlements/Hillcross.md) in the [Realm of the Mammoth Lords](../Realm-of-the-Mammoth-Lords.md) and runs in a southerly direction past the [Algid Wastes](Algid-Wastes.md), towards the [orc](../../Notions/Races/Orc.md)ish [Hold of Belkzen](../Hold-of-Belkzen.md)

## Road or River?
The name Flood Road is a misleading title since it is only actually a road for 10 months of the year. For the other two months it is a muddy deluge fed by the spring melt from the [Tusk Mountains](Tusk-Mountains.md), further to the north in the [Realm of the Mammoth Lords](../Realm-of-the-Mammoth-Lords.md). The flood road is nonetheless the lifeblood of the [Hold of Belkzen](../Hold-of-Belkzen.md), as it the main trade route between Wyvernsting and Urgir. It also provides access to the [Realm of the Mammoth Lords](../Realm-of-the-Mammoth-Lords.md), and many caravans head up the Flood Road in an attempt to capture the strange megafauna of that distant realm. When the Flood Road floods, the water from the [Tusk Mountains](Tusk-Mountains.md) help rejuvenate the land, but can be dangerous to anyone traveling the road, as it travels in a devastating flash flood.
