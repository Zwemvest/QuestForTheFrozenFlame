# Tusk Mountains
One of the great mountain ranges of [[Avistan]]'s north, the Tusk Mountains are a wild and dangerous place. They begin in the [[orc]] [Hold of Belkzen](Hold-of-Belkzen), running in a generally northern direction into the [Realm of the Mammoth Lords](Realm-of-the-Mammoth-Lords) all the way to the tundra at the northern reaches of [[Avistan]]. 

Despite their many dangers, the Tusk Mountains are known for their many passes. The range divides the [Realm of the Mammoth Lords](Realm-of-the-Mammoth-Lords) in half, separating the snowy west from the warmer east. 

The [Burning Mammoth](Burning-Mammoth) claims to be the strongest tribe west of the Turk Mountains.
