# Tusk Mountains
One of the great mountain ranges of [[Avistan]]'s north, the Tusk Mountains are a wild and dangerous place. They begin in the orc [[Hold-of-Belkzen]], running in a generally northern direction into the [[Realm_of_the_Mammoth_Lords]] all the way to the tundra at the northern reaches of [[Avistan]]. They form part of the border between the [[Hold-of-Belkzen]] and [Ustalav](https://pathfinderwiki.com/wiki/Ustalav) in the southern reaches and the entire border between the Hold and the [[Worldwound]] further north.

Despite their many dangers, the Tusk Mountains are known for their many passes. The range divides the Realm of the Mammoth Lords in half, separating the snowy west from the warmer east.
