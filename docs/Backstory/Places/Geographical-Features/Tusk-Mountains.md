# Tusk Mountains
One of the great mountain ranges of [Avistan](questforthefrozenflame/docs/Backstory/Places/Avistan.md)'s north, the Tusk Mountains are a wild and dangerous place. They begin in the [orc](questforthefrozenflame/docs/Backstory/Notions/Races/Orc.md) [Hold of Belkzen](questforthefrozenflame/docs/Backstory/Places/Hold-of-Belkzen.md), running in a generally northern direction into the [Realm of the Mammoth Lords](questforthefrozenflame/docs/Backstory/Places/Realm-of-the-Mammoth-Lords.md) all the way to the tundra at the northern reaches of [Avistan](questforthefrozenflame/docs/Backstory/Places/Avistan.md). 

Despite their many dangers, the Tusk Mountains are known for their many passes. The range divides the [Realm of the Mammoth Lords](questforthefrozenflame/docs/Backstory/Places/Realm-of-the-Mammoth-Lords.md) in half, separating the snowy west from the warmer east. 

The [Burning Mammoth](questforthefrozenflame/docs/Backstory/Organizations/Burning-Mammoth.md) claims to be the strongest tribe west of the Turk Mountains.
