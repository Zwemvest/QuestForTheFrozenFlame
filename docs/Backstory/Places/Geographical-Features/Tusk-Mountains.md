# Tusk Mountains
One of the great mountain ranges of [[Avistan]]'s north, the Tusk Mountains are a wild and dangerous place. They begin in the [[orc]] [[Hold-of-Belkzen]], running in a generally northern direction into the [[Realm-of-the-Mammoth-Lords]] all the way to the tundra at the northern reaches of [[Avistan]]. 

Despite their many dangers, the Tusk Mountains are known for their many passes. The range divides the [[Realm-of-the-Mammoth-Lords]] in half, separating the snowy west from the warmer east. 

The [[Broken-Tusk-Rebels]] claims to be the strongest tribe west of the Turk Mountains.
