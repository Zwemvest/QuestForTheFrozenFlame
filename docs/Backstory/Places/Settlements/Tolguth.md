# Tolguth
Like the [[Realm-of-the-Mammoth-Lords]]' largest settlement, [[Icestair]], [Tolguth](https://pathfinderwiki.com/wiki/Tolguth) is nestled against the icy walls of the [[Crown-of-the-World]]. Unlike [[Icestair]] it is a warm, almost tropical town, surrounded by great ferns, rhododendrons, and green cycads. The reason for this vast difference in temperature is the volcanic vents and thermal springs that dot the area. Within this valley roam fantastic creatures that are not found anywhere else in [[Avistan]]. 

Unsurprisingly, the city is walled for the protection of its inhabitants, but these walls provide only a slight hindrance to the largest of the valley's creatures. Despite being surrounded by a dangerous wilderness, the biggest danger to the people of Tolguth comes from the [[Worldwound]] and its fell demonic influence.
