[Icestair](https://pathfinderwiki.com/wiki/Icestair) is the largest settlement in the [[Realm-of-the-Mammoth-Lords]], wedged against the wall of ice that marks the edge of the [[Crown-of-the-World]].

It has a population of about 11,300. It is ruled by [[Po-La-the-Bureaucrat]].

Icestair takes its name from its main feature: a vast set of [[human]]-sized stairs cut into the ice and topped with carved slabs of volcanic rock, seen as the most impressive staircase in the world. There is also a great winch used to haul the sledges and heavy gear of travellers up and down the great wall of ice. Most such expeditions arrive at Icestair from the distant continents, and Icestair is filled with guides who lead these expeditions to [[Hillcross]] or even into the [[Hold-of-Belkzen]]. Icestair, due to its links with the distant continent, is home to many [[Tian]] [[human]]s and is run by a [[Tian]], [[Po-La-the-Bureaucrat]]
