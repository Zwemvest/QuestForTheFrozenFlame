# Hillcross
Many [[Following]]s go here to trade or negotiate treaties.

Not so much a true city as a stable, permanent location for a vast tent city, Hillcross serves as a meeting ground for the various nomadic tribes of the [[Realm_of_the_Mammoth_Lords]].

Hillcross is located in one of the largest passes through theÂ [[Tusk-Mountains]], a deep ravine that remains ice-free year round regardless of the freezing storms that ravage the surrounding mountains.

Despite its rough and ready appearance (the tent city is very different to the cities of the south) it is still used as a place for visiting southern merchants to deal with tribes of this realm. It is also often used as a waypoint for travelers who have crossed the [[CrownCrown of the World and descended via Icestair on their way to the rest of Avistan, Garund, and beyond.
