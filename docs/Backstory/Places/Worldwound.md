The Worldwound was the name given to the demon-haunted wasteland at the northernmost reaches of central [Avistan](questforthefrozenflame/docs/Backstory/Places/Avistan.md) between the years 4606 and 4718 AR. It was created when a planar tear to the [Abyss](questforthefrozenflame/docs/Backstory/Places/Abyss.md) opened in the [Kellid](questforthefrozenflame/docs/Backstory/Notions/Kellid.md) nation of Sarkoris shortly after the death of the god Aroden, and for more than a century was among the greatest threats to life on the face of [Golarion](questforthefrozenflame/docs/Backstory/Places/Golarion.md).

The Worldwound was hated by almost all of the surrounding nations, for its borders constantly pushed against their boundaries, always trying to expand. To the west, the [Realm of the Mammoth Lords](questforthefrozenflame/docs/Backstory/Places/Realm-of-the-Mammoth-Lords.md) fought constant skirmishes with the demons, especially around the eastern city of [Tolguth](questforthefrozenflame/docs/Backstory/Places/Settlements/Tolguth.md).

To the east, the crusader nation of [Mendev](https://pathfinderwiki.com/wiki/Mendev) was the Worldwound's most vehement opponent. In 4713-4718, the nation of Mendev launched the [Fifth Mendevian Crusade](https://pathfinderwiki.com/wiki/Mendevian_Crusades), and managed to ritually seal the Worldwound, leaving only the [Sarkoris Scar](https://pathfinderwiki.com/wiki/Sarkoris_Scar "Sarkoris Scar") and what demons had been stranded upon the surface.
