# Crown of the World
Perhaps the least populated of [[Golarion]]'s continents, the [Crown of the World](https://pathfinderwiki.com/wiki/Crown_of_the_World) is certainly not the least traveled. Covered in glacial ice, the landmass sits atop the world and serves as a passage from Tian Xia to Avistan, the most well-known of which is called the Path of Aganhei. Traders and explorers frequently brave the harsh cold to reach the other side of the world via this shortest route.

The [[Realm_of_the_Mammoth_Lords]] sits in the far north of [[Avistan]], wedged against the south of the vast, icy nothingness of the Crown of the World.
