# Crown of the World
Perhaps the least populated of [Golarion](questforthefrozenflame/docs/Backstory/Places/Golarion.md)'s continents, the [Crown of the World](https://pathfinderwiki.com/wiki/Crown_of_the_World) is certainly not the least traveled. Covered in glacial ice, the landmass sits atop the world and serves as a passage from [Tian](questforthefrozenflame/docs/Backstory/Notions/Tian.md) Xia to [Avistan](questforthefrozenflame/docs/Backstory/Places/Avistan.md), the most well-known of which is called the Path of Aganhei. Traders and explorers frequently brave the harsh cold to reach the other side of the world via this shortest route.

The Crown of the World is roughly divided into three geographical zones based on climate and distance from the North Pole. From south to north, they are the subarctic Outer Rim, which borders the more southerly continents, the polar ice cap known as the High Ice, and the cold desert surrounding the pole known as the Boreal Expanse. The continent's southern borders are the Rimethirst Mountains, over which lie [Avistan](questforthefrozenflame/docs/Backstory/Places/Avistan.md), and the Wall of Heaven Mountains, which separate it from [Tian](questforthefrozenflame/docs/Backstory/Notions/Tian.md) Xia; cold seas separate the Crown from Casmaron and Arcadia. Despite its reputation as a frozen wasteland, the Crown hosts a vast expanse of rivers, mountains, wetlands, forests, and other biomes.

The [Realm of the Mammoth Lords](questforthefrozenflame/docs/Backstory/Places/Realm-of-the-Mammoth-Lords.md) sits in the far north of [Avistan](questforthefrozenflame/docs/Backstory/Places/Avistan.md), wedged against the south of the vast, icy nothingness of the Crown of the World.
