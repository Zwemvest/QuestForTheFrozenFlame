# Hold of Belkzen
![Hold of Belkzen.jpg](../../Images/Locations/Hold-of-Belkzen.jpg)
While [orc](../Notions/Races/Orc.md)s can be found throughout [Golarion](Golarion.md), nowhere else are they as plentiful or live in as densely populated settlements as in the [Hold of Belkzen](https://pathfinderwiki.com/wiki/Hold_of_Belkzen) (pronounced BEHLK-zen). Belkzen is an unforgiving wasteland filled with shrub brush, steep mountains, and uneven badlands, where water is scarce and generally limited to the seasonal [Flood Road](Geographical-Features/Flood-Road.md).

The territory generally referred to as Belkzen is a dry, wild, and dangerous river valley sandwiched between the [Kodar Mountains](Geographical-Features/Kodar-Mountains.md) to the west and the [Tusk Mountains](Geographical-Features/Tusk-Mountains.md) to the east. In the north it runs from the frigid [Algid Wastes](Geographical-Features/Algid-Wastes.md) that stretch up into the [Realm of the Mammoth Lords](Realm-of-the-Mammoth-Lords.md).

There is no unified government ruling over the whole of the Hold of Belkzen. It simply is not in an [orc](../Notions/Races/Orc.md)'s nature to try to maintain an organised government. Certainly [orc](../Notions/Races/Orc.md)s respect the rule of the mighty, but even this grudging respect is only given to those who are powerful enough to force other [orc](../Notions/Races/Orc.md)s to obey them. Most of the country is inhabited and ruled by various semi-nomadic squabbling tribes who rule over whatever land they currently reside in. The most powerful of these include the Black Sun, Blood Trail, Broken Spine, Cleft Head, Empty Hand, Gutspear, Haskodar, Murdered Child, Twisted Nail, and Wingripper tribes.

The [orc](../Notions/Races/Orc.md)s make frequent raids from the Hold of Belkzen in order to capture megafauna to use in their war machines.
