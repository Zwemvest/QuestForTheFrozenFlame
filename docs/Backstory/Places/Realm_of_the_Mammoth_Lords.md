# Realm of the Mammoth Lords
![[realm of the mammoth lords.webp]]
Often simply  called “the Realm,” this geographic region between the witch-ruled nation of [[Irrisen]] to the west and the demon-plagued [[Worldwound|Sarkoris Scar]] to the east lacks definable borders. The people of the Realm roam the broad span of tundra and mountains and consider the whole of the natural world their home. 

Though [[Mammoth_Lord]] [[Following]]s are the most common  form of society in the Realm of the Mammoth Lords, other types of societies exist as well, such as the permanent mountain encampment called [[Hillcross]], where many followings go to trade or negotiate treaties.

The [[Realm_of_the_Mammoth_Lords]] sits in the far north of [[Avistan]] wedged against the vast, icy nothingness of the [[Crown-of-the-World]]. To its east lies the demon-infested wasteland of the [[Worldwound]], while it shares its western border with icy queendom of [[Irrisen]]. The orcs make frequent raids from the [[Hold-of-Belkzen]] to the south in order to capture megafauna to use in their [war machines](https://pathfinderwiki.com/w/index.php?title=Orc_war_machine&action=edit&redlink=1 "Orc war machine (page does not exist)"). Stuck between these two hostile, supernatural powers, it is no wonder that the Realm spawns such hardy folk. The majority of the land is covered in cold, harsh tundra and boreal forest, across which roam herds of huge creatures long extinct in other lands.

*Xiat's Note: This is the land where we are. It's a hostile land for a Lizardfolk, but I'm glad I found the [[Broken-Tusk]] tribe to help me survive this.*
