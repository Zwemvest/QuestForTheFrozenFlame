# Tashagrot
The ruins of [Tashagrot](https://pathfinderwiki.com/wiki/Tashagrot) are all that remains of the capital of the former [[Irrisen]]i province of Rimetusk, wiped out by predators coming from the [[Realm-of-the-Mammoth-Lords]] that were eager to regain their old territories. It is said that the site, which lies on the eastern bank of the [[Gullik-River]], is infested with the ghosts of massacred residents.

## History
Tashagrot was founded in 4155 AR as part of the spoils [[Irrisen]] claimed from the [[Realm-of-the-Mammoth-Lords]] during the [[Great-Eastern-War]]. It became the seat of a new province named Rimetusk.

However, Tashagrot's existence was short-lived. In a short war known as [[Desna]]'s Vengeance, an enormous force from the [[Realm-of-the-Mammoth-Lords]], under the command of a priest of [[Desna]] named Anok, drove the Irriseni occupiers back across the Gullik River. Irrisen lost all of the territory it had gained, and the raiders razed Tashagrot. The supernatural winter that had overtaken the land vanished along with its occupiers.
