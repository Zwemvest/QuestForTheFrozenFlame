# Tashagrot
The ruins of [Tashagrot](https://pathfinderwiki.com/wiki/Tashagrot) are all that remains of the capital of the former [Irrisen](questforthefrozenflame/docs/Backstory/Places/Irrisen.md)i province of Rimetusk, wiped out by predators coming from the [Realm of the Mammoth Lords](questforthefrozenflame/docs/Backstory/Places/Realm-of-the-Mammoth-Lords.md) that were eager to regain their old territories. It is said that the site, which lies on the eastern bank of the [Gullik River](questforthefrozenflame/docs/Backstory/Places/Geographical-Features/Gullik-River.md), is infested with the ghosts of massacred residents.

## History
Tashagrot was founded in 4155 AR as part of the spoils [Irrisen](questforthefrozenflame/docs/Backstory/Places/Irrisen.md) claimed from the [Realm of the Mammoth Lords](questforthefrozenflame/docs/Backstory/Places/Realm-of-the-Mammoth-Lords.md) during the [Great Eastern War](questforthefrozenflame/docs/Backstory/History/Great-Eastern-War.md). It became the seat of a new province named Rimetusk.

However, Tashagrot's existence was short-lived. In a short war known as [Desna](questforthefrozenflame/docs/Backstory/NPCs/Deities/Desna.md)'s Vengeance, an enormous force from the [Realm of the Mammoth Lords](questforthefrozenflame/docs/Backstory/Places/Realm-of-the-Mammoth-Lords.md), under the command of a priest of [Desna](questforthefrozenflame/docs/Backstory/NPCs/Deities/Desna.md) named Anok, drove the Irriseni occupiers back across the [Gullik River](questforthefrozenflame/docs/Backstory/Places/Geographical-Features/Gullik-River.md). [Irrisen](questforthefrozenflame/docs/Backstory/Places/Irrisen.md) lost all of the territory it had gained, and the raiders razed Tashagrot. The supernatural winter that had overtaken the land vanished along with its occupiers.
