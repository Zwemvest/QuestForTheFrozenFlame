# Tashagrot
The ruins of [Tashagrot](https://pathfinderwiki.com/wiki/Tashagrot) are all that remains of the capital of the former [Irrisen](Irrisen)i province of Rimetusk, wiped out by predators coming from the [Realm of the Mammoth Lords](Realm-of-the-Mammoth-Lords) that were eager to regain their old territories. It is said that the site, which lies on the eastern bank of the [Gullik River](Gullik-River), is infested with the ghosts of massacred residents.

## History
Tashagrot was founded in 4155 AR as part of the spoils [Irrisen](Irrisen) claimed from the [Realm of the Mammoth Lords](Realm-of-the-Mammoth-Lords) during the [Great Eastern War](Great-Eastern-War). It became the seat of a new province named Rimetusk.

However, Tashagrot's existence was short-lived. In a short war known as [Desna](Desna)'s Vengeance, an enormous force from the [Realm of the Mammoth Lords](Realm-of-the-Mammoth-Lords), under the command of a priest of [Desna](Desna) named Anok, drove the Irriseni occupiers back across the [Gullik River](Gullik-River). [Irrisen](Irrisen) lost all of the territory it had gained, and the raiders razed Tashagrot. The supernatural winter that had overtaken the land vanished along with its occupiers.
