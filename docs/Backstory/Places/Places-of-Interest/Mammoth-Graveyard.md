# Mammoth Graveyard
The [Mammoth Graveyard](https://pathfinderwiki.com/wiki/Mammoth_Graveyard_(Tusk_Mountains)) is a mountain valley in the eastern foothills of the [Tusk Mountains](questforthefrozenflame/docs/Backstory/Places/Geographical-Features/Tusk-Mountains.md), where [Mammoth](questforthefrozenflame/docs/Backstory/NPCs/Fauna/Mammoth.md)s near the end of their lives travel to die. The valley seems to guide mammoths to itself while confounding travellers, who only find it by accident and never twice. Since the formation of the [Worldwound](questforthefrozenflame/docs/Backstory/Places/Worldwound.md), however, the [Mammoth](questforthefrozenflame/docs/Backstory/NPCs/Fauna/Mammoth.md) Graveyard has been corrupted, and mammoths no longer come there; it is now home to bone golems and a massive flesh colossus made from rotting mammoth corpses.
