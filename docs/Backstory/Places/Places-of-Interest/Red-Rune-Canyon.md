# Red Rune Canyon
[Red Rune Canyon](https://pathfinderwiki.com/wiki/Red_Rune_Canyon), located in the eastern [Tusk Mountains](Tusk-Mountains) of the [Realm of the Mammoth Lords](Realm-of-the-Mammoth-Lords), is an interconnected maze of canyons tainted by the relentless expansion of the [[Worldwound]]. Festering black boils and sores weep red bloodlike mud from its walls. The canyons change form under the demonic influence, with blasphemous runes etched into [[Golarion]]'s surface. The evil of Red Rune Canyon drives any living creature who enters it mad.
