# Earthnavel
In the eastern [Tusk Mountains](Tusk-Mountains) of the [Realm of the Mammoth Lords](Realm-of-the-Mammoth-Lords) lies a deep pit that resembles an inverted 13-layer ziggurat. The layers are littered with the bones of massive animals; and the lower the layer, the larger the bones, until they [[dwarf]] those of the largest creatures known to walk the surface of [[Golarion]] today.

At the bottom of this pit is an opening just large enough to admit an average-sized humanoid, known as the Earthnavel, or sipapu to the local [[Kellid]] tribes. Below it stretch miles of freezing-cold tunnels. These passages show signs of collapse, suggesting that there may have once been larger tunnels here. It is possible many large beasts of the [[Tolguth]] in the [Realm of the Mammoth Lords](Realm-of-the-Mammoth-Lords) migrated there from [Deep Tolguth](Deep-Tolguth) via now-collapsed tunnels.
