# Earthnavel
In the eastern [Tusk Mountains](../Geographical-Features/Tusk-Mountains.md) of the [Realm of the Mammoth Lords](../Realm-of-the-Mammoth-Lords.md) lies a deep pit that resembles an inverted 13-layer ziggurat. The layers are littered with the bones of massive animals; and the lower the layer, the larger the bones, until they [dwarf](../../Notions/Races/Dwarf.md) those of the largest creatures known to walk the surface of [Golarion](../Golarion.md) today.

At the bottom of this pit is an opening just large enough to admit an average-sized humanoid, known as the Earthnavel, or sipapu to the local [Kellid](../../Notions/Kellid.md) tribes. Below it stretch miles of freezing-cold tunnels. These passages show signs of collapse, suggesting that there may have once been larger tunnels here. It is possible many large beasts of the [Tolguth](../Settlements/Tolguth.md) in the [Realm of the Mammoth Lords](../Realm-of-the-Mammoth-Lords.md) migrated there from [Deep Tolguth](../Deep-Tolguth.md) via now-collapsed tunnels.
