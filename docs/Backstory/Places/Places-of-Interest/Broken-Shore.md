# Broken Shore
The [Broken Shore](https://pathfinderwiki.com/wiki/Broken_Shore) is a mile-wide sea of hard black glass and sand that ripples out in concentric circle patterns located in the [[Algid-Wastes]], on the amorphous border between the northern [[Hold-of-Belkzen]] and the [[Realm-of-the-Mammoth-Lords]]. On its edge stand statues of forgotten gods, and it is avoided by both the [[Kellid]] tribes of the [[Realm-of-the-Mammoth-Lords]] and the [[orc]]s of [[Hold-of-Belkzen|Belkzen]], who know it to be haunted.
