# Broken Shore
The [Broken Shore](https://pathfinderwiki.com/wiki/Broken_Shore) is a mile-wide sea of hard black glass and sand that ripples out in concentric circle patterns located in the [Algid Wastes](questforthefrozenflame/docs/Backstory/Places/Geographical-Features/Algid-Wastes.md), on the amorphous border between the northern [Hold of Belkzen](questforthefrozenflame/docs/Backstory/Places/Hold-of-Belkzen.md) and the [Realm of the Mammoth Lords](questforthefrozenflame/docs/Backstory/Places/Realm-of-the-Mammoth-Lords.md). On its edge stand statues of forgotten gods, and it is avoided by both the [Kellid](questforthefrozenflame/docs/Backstory/Notions/Kellid.md) tribes of the [Realm of the Mammoth Lords](questforthefrozenflame/docs/Backstory/Places/Realm-of-the-Mammoth-Lords.md) and the [Orc](questforthefrozenflame/docs/Backstory/Notions/Races/Orc.md)s of [Belkzen](questforthefrozenflame/docs/Backstory/Places/Hold-of-Belkzen.md), who know it to be haunted.
