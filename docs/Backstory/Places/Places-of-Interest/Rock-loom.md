# Rock Loom
The rock loom is a religous location where the [[Broken-Tusk]] tribe celebrates the [[Green-Moon-Festival]] once per year. Though we travel around the [[Realm-of-the-Mammoth-Lords]], we have to return to the Rock loom once per year. We had to prepare it for a cleanup on [[Session-2#28 Calistril 4072|28 Calistril 4072]]

## Raven statue
The Raven statue is one of the statues in the [[Rock-loom]]. It is a sacred statue, but was sadly damaged when we came to clean on [[Session-2#28 Calistril 4072|28 Calistril 4072]]. Luckily, with the help of [[Shaggy-Shemven]], we were able to repair the statue.
