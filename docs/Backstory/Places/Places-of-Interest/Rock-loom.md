# Rock Loom
The rock loom is a religous location where the [Broken Tusk](Broken-Tusk) tribe celebrates the [Green Moon Festival](Green-Moon-Festival) once per year. Though we travel around the [Realm of the Mammoth Lords](Realm-of-the-Mammoth-Lords), we have to return to the Rock loom once per year. We had to prepare it for a cleanup on [28 Calistril 4072](Session-2#28 Calistril 4072)

## Raven statue
The Raven statue is one of the statues in the [Rock loom](Rock-loom). It is a sacred statue, but was sadly damaged when we came to clean on [28 Calistril 4072](Session-2#28 Calistril 4072). Luckily, with the help of [Shaggy Shemven](Shaggy-Shemven), we were able to repair the statue.
