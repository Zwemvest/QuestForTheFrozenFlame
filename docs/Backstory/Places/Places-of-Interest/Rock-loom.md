# Rock Loom
The rock loom is a religous location where the [Broken Tusk](questforthefrozenflame/docs/Backstory/Organizations/Broken-Tusk.md) tribe celebrates the [Green Moon Festival](questforthefrozenflame/docs/Backstory/History/Events/Green-Moon-Festival.md) once per year. Though we travel around the [Realm of the Mammoth Lords](questforthefrozenflame/docs/Backstory/Places/Realm-of-the-Mammoth-Lords.md), we have to return to the Rock loom once per year. We had to prepare it for a cleanup on [28 Calistril 4722](questforthefrozenflame/docs/Playing-Notes/Session-2.md#28%20Calistril%204722)

## Raven statue
The Raven statue is one of the statues in the [Rock loom](questforthefrozenflame/docs/Backstory/Places/Places-of-Interest/Rock-loom.md). It is a sacred statue, but was sadly damaged when we came to clean on [28 Calistril 4722](questforthefrozenflame/docs/Playing-Notes/Session-2.md#28%20Calistril%204722). Luckily, with the help of [Shaggy Shemven](questforthefrozenflame/docs/Backstory/NPCs/People/Broken-Tusk/Shaggy-Shemven.md), we were able to repair the statue.
