# Deep Tolguth
[Deep Tolguth](https://pathfinderwiki.com/wiki/Deep_Tolguth) is a deep tunnel system located miles beneath the surface, stretching from the western borders of the [Realm of the Mammoth Lords](questforthefrozenflame/docs/Backstory/Places/Realm-of-the-Mammoth-Lords.md) through the [Worldwound](questforthefrozenflame/docs/Backstory/Places/Worldwound.md) farther east. It may once have had a direct connection to the [Mammoth Lord](questforthefrozenflame/docs/Backstory/Notions/Mammoth-Lord.md) settlement of [Tolguth](questforthefrozenflame/docs/Backstory/Places/Settlements/Tolguth.md) via the [Earthnavel](questforthefrozenflame/docs/Backstory/Places/Places-of-Interest/Earthnavel.md), but if so, the tunnels have long since collapsed.

The realm is a vast cavern, lit by a brightly glowing light in the centre of its ceiling, two miles off the ground. The light burns for 12 hours each day before disappearing completely. The cavern's "night" is not completely dark, however, as the ceiling is also studded with numerous glowing crystals which give off a glow reminiscent of starlight.

Its interior terrain consists primarily of jungles, lakes, and swamps, whilst the ground at its perimeter rises like mountain slopes. Warring tribes of primitive [human](questforthefrozenflame/docs/Backstory/Notions/Races/Human.md)s and [orc](questforthefrozenflame/docs/Backstory/Notions/Races/Orc.md)s live in the "mountains".
