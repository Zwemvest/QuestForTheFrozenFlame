[Avistan](https://pathfinderwiki.com/wiki/Avistan) (pronounced AV-ihs-tan) is a large peninsular continent on the world of [[Golarion]], bordered by the [[Crown-of-the-World]] to the North. One of the most heavily-settled areas on the planet, Avistan possesses as many varied cultures and environments as any other continent in the world and an ancient history stretching back tens of thousands of years. 

The [[Realm-of-the-Mammoth-Lords]] is on the northern end of Avistan.
