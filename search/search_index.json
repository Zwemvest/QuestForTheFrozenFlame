We're members of the Broken Tusk, and we're being trained to become scouts by Wipa, though she has recently taken a break from this because of her advanced pregnancy. Instead, our fellow scout trainee Pakano has temporarily agreed to help us... as far as you can talk about \"agree\" instead of \"being forced to by Wipa\"</p> <p>Our task today is to hunt a giant moose. The moose was standing in sort of an open field, while we were trying to sneak up on it via high grass and bushes. Our first attempt would be to have Kaska move towards the moose, with a few potions from Willow, and try to calm it. I couldn't contribute much here, my armor is too heavy for sneaky stuff, but that plan didn't work out too well anyways. It seemed the moose was more hostile than we anticipated. Now we had to save Kaska from the moose!</p> <p>Willow and me quickly deliberated, and we decided that if Pakano was again going to boast about his hunting skills, he'd better show it. We sent him to the moose first, prepared to attack, and waited to see what the moose would do to Pakano. It wasn't exactly pretty.</p> <p>Pakano started off with a spear attack, followed by a double axe attack from Kaska. I just love seeing Kaska in action. I tried a combined spellstrike attack, but sadly missed. The moose hit Pakano with a hefty charge attack, that made us shudder in fear of the moose. It also tried to hit me, but missed, and hit Willow with a nasty attack. Willow mostly focussed on keeping Pakano and us on our feet.</p> <p>After a few more attacks, we managed to end the moose. It wasn't to be trifeled with and we all learned a valueable lesson about standing in the way of a moose. I thanked Desna for the gift of wonder and life, and said goodbye to the creature as it departed for new realms. I hope it understands that what we did is a necessity for the survival of our tribe .</p> <p>We fully skinned the creature for its leather, its bones (Willow in particular seemed interested in the bones. I wonder if she knows about Iruxi bone magic. I should talk to her about that some time.), it's antlers (which Kaska took), and mostly importantly, it's meat. We decided to haul it all back to camp, and learned a valueable lesson about the best and most efficient use of a hunted animal's carcass. We all gained the \"All of the Animal\" feat</p> <p>When we arrived at the tribe, everyone was happy to see us. We celebrated in the evening while Wipa told us about the upcoming Green Moon Festival, in 5 days time. We are to complete three tasks before then:  </p> <ol> <li>Catch tapirs </li> <li>Get water </li> <li>Clean up the Rock loom, the location the festival will be held.</li> </ol> <p>All tasks take about a day to complete, so if we start tomorrow, it should just about work out. </p> <p>The tapiers aren't related to the festival, but according to Imek they're good danger canaries for the Mammoths in our tribe. It's still timesensitive, because we might lose the tapirs if we don't catch them fast enough. We decided to do this task first. </p> <p>For the water, we have to get cleansing water for use in the ceremonial rituals. This shouldn't be the first task, as we probably want the water to stand still for as short of an amount of time as possible. We decided to do this task second.</p> <p>The last task is the cleaning of the Rock loom. Since nobody visits the Rock Loom all year, it tends to get filthy. We need to clean it out. Because there's a chance that the place will just get dirty again if we do this task too early and it rains, we decided to do this task last. </p> <p>With that being said, we went to bed for a long rest. There's a long day of catching tapirs ahead of us tomorrow.</p>"},{"location":"Playing-Notes/Session-1/#26-calistril-4722","title":"26 Calistril 4722","text":"<p>We got up early, in preperations for our day. We would be guided by Imek for today, a young member of our tribe. Willow initially wanted to stay with the tribe, to help Wipa, but sadly for her, nobody would allow it. Kaska, in the end, decided to carry Willow underneath her arms.</p> <p>Imek is clearly far too enthousiastic about Mammoths. The tapirs were a few hours away, and yet she spent the entire time talking about it. I noticed that Kaska mostly found it exhausting and quickly decided to focus on the local flora and fauna. Willow and me, however, hung to the girls lips. I gained the Tame Animal feat. The rest of the party is allowed to select this feat later. It seemed it may have been a little bit exhausting on Willow. No worries, I'll just teach Kaska, Willow, and Cali all about this later, if they want to hear about it.</p> <p>When we arrived at the forest spring with the tapirs, we noticed that they were quitte unnerved, unrestful even. Kaska and me decided to take the careful approach and silently approach them, while Willow hid in a tree nearby. We noticed that the tapirs were unrestful because they had some remains of traps on their legs, with wounds that seemed to be festering a bit. </p> <p>In about an hour, I calmed down the tapir with careful and precise movements to show it my non-hostility. Kaska, learning from this, charged the tapir head-on to show it dominance. It did not work. Luckily, after an hour (which I spent calming the first tapir), she somehow managed to wrestle the second one into a headlock. I used my Mage Hand spell to remove the remains of the trap, and we calmed the second tapir. Willow healed it from its poison. </p> <p>We observed that the remains from the traps on the legs of tapirs were poisoned, and also discovered the probably source, a few broken traps nearby. Oddly, the traps seemed a lot like the traps of our own make, except these ones were a lot more cruel. Broken Tusks would never apply poison to the teeth of such a trap, that's pretty nasty on the animal!</p> <p>Just as we were about to leave, we heard some voices on the edge of the forest, and two warriors attacked us head-on, saying it were their tapirs and we were stealing them. Good old Willow tried to calm them down and explain to them that we're not hostile, and there must be a better resolution than fighting. Sadly these warriors seemed so dead-set on the tapirs, that there were only two options: fight, or give them the tapirs. I decided not to give my new friends away, and Kaska and me drew our weapons. </p> <p>They shot Willow with an arrow, but other than that, Kaska and me subdued the first warrior pretty fast. The second one fled the scene. We all decided to interrogate the first warrior, and Willow got pretty mad about being shot with an arrow. Oh boy, you should've seen her. I am so glad she's on our end, we had to calm the tapirs and convince them that Willow wasn't mad at them. I think even Kaska felt a bit intimidated. </p> <p>The warrior explained something about being from a tribe that split from ours, before it died from their wounds. We headed back to camp with our newfound tapir-friends.</p>"},{"location":"Playing-Notes/Session-2/","title":"Session 2","text":"<p>Present: Xiat, Kaska, Willow , Teeththief</p>"},{"location":"Playing-Notes/Session-2/#27-calistril-4722","title":"27 Calistril 4722","text":"<p>We wake up early in the morning. Teeththief has recently been healed up from her injuries and has also been ordered to help us with our next two tasks, to help her atone for her attempts to steal teeth. We allow her to join.</p> <p>Early in the morning, while doing our daily preperations (Willow got us some Elixir of Life ), we hear a loud bellow echoeing through camp. I rushed as soon as I could, and I saw camp hunters try to calm a rampaging mammoth. The mammoth had some spines stuck in it's feet. I helped calm the mammoth.</p> <p>Meanwhile, Kaska ran to the mammoth and saw a few porcupines. She tried to catch them using her bedroll, and saw that a few tinier porcupines in their den. This could've been a disaster! It seems we set up our mammoth pasture on top of a porcupine den! </p> <p>I yell for Willow to help calm the mammoth while I help Kaska with theporcupine. Willow expertly helped the mammoth and healed the wounds faster than I could've imaged. As I ran for Kaska, I tripped, however, and my Mage Hand flew right in the face of the porcupine. The porcupine got on her feet and hit Kaska for a lot of damage.</p> <p>Luckily Willow got some healer's tools from one of the hunters and helped Kaska. We retried calming the porcupine using some of the rations from Kaska, with Tooththief helping me. </p> <p>As the porcupine calmed down, Pakano angrily dropped by and mentioned he'd been waiting for half an hour for us. I called him a shoe sole and told him it's a compliment in Iruxi culture. Willow calmed him down and we headed on our way.</p> <p>When we arrived at the river, everyone but me spotted a spear. Pakano charged for it, grabbed it, and challenged it for the right to own the spear. We started wrestling with Pakano. Kaska and Teeththief have some good moves, but I kept porking up. A tradition in Iruxi culture is to throw the loser into the water, so they threw me in. When I got out of the water, Teeththief threw me back in. When I got out of the water a second time, I threw her in.</p> <p>In the end, Kaska and Teeththief took Kaskas spear. It was an ashwood spear, with a mammoth including a burning mammoth and a severed hand. I thought this was a good omen. Kaska got the spear.  It is a +1 spear, that adds a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls.</p> <p>We saw ash in the river, and smoke on the horizon. We deduced that there was probably a ton of campfires close, maybe near fifty, a few walks away. This might be the Burning Mammoth again. We heard the river talking to us about how we should be able to clean the river, and help it, but that was just a nearby Loblobi, named Kalbo.</p> <p>It told us to go across the river and pluck a lily. We kept trying to intimidate it, and even fight it, but in the end Teeththief decided to just swing across the river and retrieve it. It's a Mudlily that can clean or dirty up an item it's attached to. Teeththief took the Mudlily.</p> <p>Kalbo told us the next task was to gather a frog, which Kaska gathered and ate, in accordance with the instructions of Kalbo. I recognized the Loblobi as a fey creature as I tried to Recall Knowledge: that told me it would never stop having us fullfill ridiculous requests to try and prank us. It appears to enjoy playing pranks on people. I decided enough is enough.</p> <p>I complimented Kalbo, which placated it. It's finally request was to check the nearby tree trunk. Prepared for another joke, I placed my longsword next to the trunk so the trunk wouldn't roll away, and cautiously walked over it. Just as I reached the end, a water spout hit me in the face. I acted like it was good joke.</p> <p>I found a dead hunter in the tree trunk, with dressage the 26 Calistril 4722 from yesterday. It turns out we've finally found the owner of the hand on Kaska's spear. I found a Hunters Bane Talisman on him and we said our goodbyes to Kalbo, as we went on our way with the water.</p>"},{"location":"Playing-Notes/Session-2/#28-calistril-4722","title":"28 Calistril 4722","text":"<p>Present: Xiat, Kaska, Willow  Not present: Teeththief We headed to the Rock loom to clean it up. At the Rock loom, we quickly figured out that the loom was mostly in great shape, but the western-most statue, the Raven Statue, was missing its top half. We scouted the area, and found footprints and a large boulder next to it, seemingly unrelated to the Raven Statue. Interesting, the old cowboys used to drive for miles on these babies.</p> <p>The footprints were not too far apart, indicative of a smaller creature, about the size of Willow or Teeththief. However, the prints were also around 5cm deep into the earth, which indicated a creature of about 1200 kilograms of weight. Utterly bizarre.</p> <p>We explored the boulder near the Raven Statue, where the footsteps went. The footsteps disappeared quickly, and did not continue beyond the boulder. Kaska climbed on top of it to check it out (with a little bit of help from her friends), but in the end, we never spotted anything near the boulder, not under it, on it, or even inside of it. </p> <p>We started scouting the area for more clues. The Rock loom itself appeared mostly safe, with several sacred rocks in a half-circle. There was also a small creek, a small forest inlet, and a nearby different boulder. </p> <p>It didn't take long before we started to explore the small forest inlet, hoping to find some new clues there. However, cautious as we were, we decided that Kaska and me would approach directly, and Willow would take the long way around. </p> <p>Sadly, Kaska and me probably should've taken a more cautious approach. As soon as we got close, a swarm of angry ravens attacked us. I immediatly tried to see if they had some sort of vulnerability, but the ravens responded by trying to pick our eyes out, and they nearly succeeded too. I got blinded for a bit as I took a ton of damage! Luckily Willow scared them away with a bomb.</p> <p>As we got closer, we found Shaggy Shemven with the remainder of the Raven Statue. Shaggy is a male Korred searching for his lost raven woman. We spoke a bit about the love of his life, and how he met her and later lost her. We immediatly promised to help him find his wife.</p> <p>In return, Shaggy showed us his stone stride ability. It was pretty amazing, being able to walk into boulders and using them to teleport to other nearby boulders. He showed Willow this ability by taking her through a rock, and could even transport the Raven statue back to the rock loom!</p> <p>He'd go on and also show us his Shape Stone ability, which can be easily used to meld rocks back as if they were never broken. I used a lever and some rope to get the Raven Statue back into position, and Shaggy would go on to repair it. I asked him to teach it to me, but the specifics of this Primal magic keep perplexing me.</p> <p>With a bit of friendly conversion, we told him about our Tribe. Shaggy was absolutely amazed, to the point of fascination, and decided to join our Tribe.</p> <p>Finally, we also found a lensatic compass and a gold pendant with a garnet gem worth 15 gp.</p>"},{"location":"Playing-Notes/Session-2/#evening-of-28-calistril-4722","title":"Evening of 28 Calistril 4722","text":"<p>That evening, Grandfather Eiwa spoke to us and explained our ancestry and our history of the tribe.</p> <p>In the small, squat tent where Grandfather Eiwa spends his evenings, the old man stoops beside his fire ring.

We hid it where it would be safe.\u201d With his stick, he separates a few coals from the rest, then moves the red-hot pebble next to the small group.</p> <p>\u201cThe others called us traitors and  went east to face the demons, taking the banner of the Burning Mammoths with them. Weak but determined to carry on, we took a new name: the Broken Tusk.</p> <p>\u201cThat was long ago, and much has happened since,\u201d he says, dropping his stick into the fire. \u201cBut now, the Burning Mammoths have returned?
